Reopening necessitates that adequate personal protective equipment and diagnostic testing are available.\n4. Reopening requires a monitoring and surveillance program that allows the commonwealth to deploy swift actions for containment or mitigation.\n5.

			"body": "<i>[Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. [Sign up for our free weekly newsletter](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters).</i>\n\nNew figures released Thursday show black Pennsylvanians make up a disproportionate amount of coronavirus cases across the commonwealth. But public health officials who released the numbers [amid pressure to share more demographic information](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/spl/pennsylvania-coronavirus-racial-data-philadelphia-rachel-levine-20200407.html) about COVID-19 cases cautioned that the data represent only a quarter of confirmed cases.\n\nWhile other states and municipalities have publicized data on the race of COVID-19 patients for weeks, Pennsylvania has struggled to collect comprehensive demographics, which experts and some lawmakers say are vital to public health officials’ ability to target resources and begin to scale back social distancing.\n\nThough the state’s data on race is incomplete, the virus’ spread in minority communities can be tracked in other ways. Sharrelle Barber, an assistant research professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Drexel University, said geographic data on cases down to the zip code or neighborhood can be linked with census indicators to help fill the gaps.\n\nBut the state Department of Health, which has addresses for the majority of those tested and those who have died, has resisted calls to publish case and death counts that are more granular than county-level.\n\nStill, an outsize impact on African Americans can be gleaned from what information is available. Of the 26% of patients the Department of Health released race data on, about a third are black, though black Pennsylvanians make up just 12% of the population, according to 2019 census estimates.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/donate/\"></div>\n\nConversely, the department’s data show that 63% of those patients are white — and whites make up about 80% of the population. But the state does not have reliable data on ethnicity, so that category could include some Hispanics and people of Middle Eastern descent, a Department of Health spokesperson said.\n\nThe trend is consistent with numbers released by other states across the country and municipalities in Pennsylvania showing the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on black and brown people, who have higher rates of chronic disease and represent an outsize portion of workers deemed “essential” who are still interacting in person.\n\nThe publication of the data on race came amid mounting pressure from public health experts and days after The Inquirer filed requests for the information under Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know Law.\n\nPublic health experts say officials and providers can’t wait until the pandemic recedes to better report, collect, and publish demographic information.\n\n“We’re not wanting data for the sake of data,” Barber said. “We’re wanting data so we can mitigate this disproportionate impact in certain communities and come up with short- and long-term policy solutions to save lives.”\n\nThe Wolf administration has published the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for every county in Pennsylvania and created a public dashboard of hospital preparedness data. It also this week began releasing county-by-county data on cases and deaths in elder-care facilities, as well as a breakdown of cases by sex.\n\nDepartment of Health spokesperson Nate Wardle said Thursday officials are working to provide more data to the public, and Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday [announced a task force](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-lt-gov-fetterman-new-task-force-for-health-disparity-to-address-how-covid-19-affects-minorities/) to be led by Lt. Gov. John Fetterman that will study health disparities in Pennsylvania’s vulnerable communities.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Frank Dermody said reliable information is “one of the best weapons” for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and acknowledged the racial disparities already emerging, though data are limited.\n\n“Having more information helps us determine where to put resources and, eventually, decide when some restrictions can be lifted,” Dermody (D., Allegheny) said. “The state’s working hard to get more information from all the private labs doing much of the testing.”\n\n<iframe title=\"Coronavirus Cases in Pennsylvania\" aria-label=\"USA pennsylvania counties Symbol map\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-aOJf2\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aOJf2/78/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"430\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}(); </script>\n\nCounties without health departments rely on the state to be forthcoming with the data it has. Sen. Tim Kearney (D., Delaware) has pushed for more data concerning Delaware County, which doesn’t have its own health department. Instead, officials there partnered with nearby Chester County, which does have a health department, to collect and share information.\n\n“This is not a long-term fix,” Kearney said, “but it is providing enough information right now to guide our local response to prioritize antibody testing, protect long-term care facilities, and more.”\n\nCounty-level figures without information on case numbers by zip code or municipality can be problematic, said Shiriki Kumanyika, emeritus professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania and chair of the Council on Black Health at Drexel. This is particularly true, she said, in counties that are primarily rural but have an urban area, like Lackawanna County, home to thousands of acres of farm and rural land and also the city of Scranton.\n\nKumanyika said that without more granular geographic information, “it would totally dilute the sense of what’s going on.”\n\nWolf’s administration said the state has provided necessary information to local emergency management and other officials.\n\nPennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said this week efforts to collect data on patients has been stymied by an [outdated system that allows health-care workers to skip some fields](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/spl/pennsylvania-coronavirus-labs-testing-information-race-age-gender-20200413.html) when sending specimens to the state’s public health lab in Exton.\n\nThe process starts with medical professionals, who in some cases don’t ask patients for demographic information. In other cases, private laboratories have the information but don’t report it to the state, even though the form submitted along with the sample includes fields for the patient’s address, date of birth, sex, ethnicity, and race.\n\nThis week, Levine put new pressure on doctors and laboratories to report such information. It will be difficult to enforce, she said, so “we’re going to rely on health-care providers and laboratories to do the right thing.”\n\nSome counties with their own health departments have been more forthcoming. [Philadelphia city officials earlier this month](https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-coronavirus-race-african-american-cases-rising-20200403.html)publicized some data on race, though it represented less than a third of confirmed cases in the city. Those figures showed while most early cases were among white patients, new cases overwhelmingly affected black residents. As of this week, the city health department now has data on race for two-thirds of its more than 7,000 cases.\n\n[It has also published graphics](https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/testing-and-data/) showing cases and deaths by age, gender and zip code.\n\n<iframe title=\"Coronavirus Cases in Philadelphia\" aria-label=\"choropleth map\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-kHSsx\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kHSsx/35/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"550\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}})}(); </script>\n\nAmie Downs, a spokesperson for Allegheny County’s health department — which has begun releasing data on race and ethnicity — said the department is monitoring cases by race because “communities of color already have poorer health outcomes in Allegheny County, and it is critical to know if COVID-19 is affecting those communities to a greater degree.”\n\nLast week, New Jersey released available data on race, noting it represented 21% of confirmed COVID-19 patients in the state. As of last Friday, the data showed the disease had an outsize presence among black New Jerseyans, who make up 13.6% of the population but 25% of the confirmed cases.\n\nOther states and municipalities have more comprehensive data and information-sharing capabilities. Consider New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak in America, [which has publicized data points](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) like testing and cases by zip code; case and death rates by race; and cases, hospitalizations, and deaths broken down by neighborhood, age, and gender.\n\nAdvocacy organizations that work in minority communities need the information, too. Jennifer Clarke, executive director of the Philadelphia-based Public Interest Law Center, said the organization uses federal survey information to develop its programming “all the time.”\n\nFor example, the law center started work on housing and evictions about five years ago, responding to data showing people evicted in Philadelphia were disproportionately women of color with children. That information allowed the group to lobby for targeted policy solutions.\n\n“We know there are these inequalities,” she said, “and we can’t even begin to address them if we can't see who is sick and where they’re sick.”\n\n<i><b>100% ESSENTIAL:</b> Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

There is currently no timeline to recall them back to work, according to Gov. Tom Wolf’s Office of Administration.\n\nSome of the departments impacted include revenue and transportation, state officials said. It wasn’t immediately clear which other departments were affected, though several employ seasonal workers, including the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, which oversees state park facilities, and the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board\n\nEmployees who work for the state health and labor departments, which are central to the coronavirus response, were not impacted, state officials said.\n\n“While we work to fund the increased need for essential state services, there has been, and will continue to be, a decline in revenue coming into the state,” the Office of Administration, to which the governor’s office referred questions, said in a statement. “The state is taking a measured approach to the COVID-19 outbreak and that includes managing our finances.”\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/donate/\"></div>\n\nThe layoffs Friday could be the first in a wave of job losses within state government, which is bracing for hundreds of millions of dollars in [lost revenues as businesses shut down](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-pa-coronavirus-state-budget-revenues-shortfall/ \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-pa-coronavirus-state-budget-revenues-shortfall/\"), unemployment claims [spike to unparalleled levels](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-pa-coronavirus-shutdown-unemployment-jobless-claims/ \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-pa-coronavirus-shutdown-unemployment-jobless-claims/\"), and more people seek other public assistance benefits.\n\nAlready, Wolf has ordered a hiring freeze and general purchasing ban for state agencies in an effort to cut spending.\n\nDavid Fillman is executive director of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Council 13, which represents the majority of the state workers who were laid off. On Sunday, he said the union still had not received official notification from the commonwealth or information about which workers were affected.\n\nUntil he does, it is unclear what those workers’ rights are, though they have fewer protections than full-time workers.\n\nTemporary, part-time, and seasonal workers are there to fill in the gaps, Fillman said. When full-time employees become ill, “that exacerbates the problem of getting rid of the part-time \\[workers].”\n\n“It is going to be a difficult road as we deal with this pandemic,” Fillman said.\n\nFor the past two weeks, state officials have been focused on preventing the health system from being overwhelmed with a crush of sick patients.\n\nThe legislature has approved [$50 million in emergency funding](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-coronavirus-emergency-funding-fifty-million-masks-vents/ \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-coronavirus-emergency-funding-fifty-million-masks-vents/\") that Wolf can provide to hospitals, nursing homes, and emergency medical providers to buy equipment and supplies. The administration has also relaxed licensing and other requirements for retired doctors, nurses, medical students, pharmacists, and other health care workers.\n\nWolf has also shut down schools statewide and issued stay-at-home orders for residents in 22 counties. On Saturday, the governor added Centre, Beaver, and Washington Counties to that list, directing residents there to remain at home unless they need medicine, food, or other services essential to living.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nBut packing one of the biggest punches to the state’s finances is Wolf’s order late last week to close businesses that do not provide “life-sustaining” services or products. His administration has set up a waiver process, but it has been criticized as [chaotic and opaque](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-pa-coronavirus-business-shutdown-waiver-tom-wolf-joe-scarnati/ \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-pa-coronavirus-business-shutdown-waiver-tom-wolf-joe-scarnati/\").\n\nThe coronavirus response has already taxed Pennsylvania’s resources, leaving the state to contend with declining revenues and a sharp spike in demand for public assistance. Pennsylvania residents have filed about 745,000 applications for unemployment compensation benefits in the past two weeks.\n\nCompounding the picture is the uncertainty of how bad the outbreak will be — and how long it will last.\n\nDuring a briefing with reporters Saturday, Wolf said Pennsylvania and its local governments could get about $5 billion from the federal stimulus package just approved by Congress.\n\n“But that’s going to be allocated in ways that have yet to be made known to at least us in Harrisburg,” Wolf said.\n\nHealth officials on Sunday reported 643 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the statewide total to 3,394.\n\n<i><b>100% ESSENTIAL:</b> Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

[Sign up for Spotlight PA’s newsletter.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters\")</i>\n\nHARRISBURG — Inmate advocacy groups and corrections officers alike are worried that a coronavirus outbreak inside Pennsylvania’s state prisons is an inevitability, and that should one occur, it could spread quickly because of the difficulty of practicing “social distancing.”\n\nOfficials with the state Department of Corrections said they have taken preventative measures, such as making hand sanitizer more widely available among staff, requiring employees to wear face masks, and hiring a centralized doctor as a special adviser.\n\nAs of early Friday evening, there were no reported cases of the coronavirus inside the state prison system, either among those incarcerated or corrections officers.\n\nBut the union representing about 10,000 Pennsylvania corrections officers is concerned that ongoing inmate transfers and rising tensions could mean an outbreak is on the horizon.\n\n“One of the biggest issues is that we have asked the governor's office to stop all non-essential transports of inmates, and we haven't been successful in getting a response from that,” said Larry Blackwell, head of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association.\n\nBlackwell said inmate movement is “putting all our staff and inmates at risk.”\n\nAdvocates for those incarcerated in the prisons, meanwhile, said those serving time behind bars are particularly vulnerable should the virus take hold.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/donate/\"></div>\n\n\"Environments of a prison are the perfect transmittal ground, and they are exactly where this virus is going to be the most pervasive and severe once it gets in,\" said Claire Shubik-Richards, executive director of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, a Philadelphia-based advocacy group.\n\nMaria Finn, a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections, said each facility has a plan to isolate infected inmates, quarantine those exposed, and to do enhanced cleaning. She also said the state is clamping on the flow of new inmates and parole violators entering the system.\n\nBeginning Saturday, officials plan to send new male inmates and parole violators to SCI Retreat in Luzerne County, while transferring most of the people currently held there to other prisons in the state, Finn said. The department is increasing medical staff and supplies at Retreat, as well.\n\n(The facility had been slated to close at the end of June, and was at just over 60% capacity a month ago, according to the department.)\n\nAfter an “intake quarantine period,” new inmates will go to SCI Camp Hill for classification and evaluation. On average, the state receives roughly 150 new male inmates each week, Finn said.\n\nFinn said the change will “greatly \\[reduce] the ways the virus can enter our system.”\n\nRob Pezzeca, who is currently incarcerated at SCI Forest in northwest Pennsylvania, said in an interview Friday that staff at the prison are taking precautions to prevent the introduction of the virus.\n\nHe said they wear masks and have their temperatures taken before entering the facility. Inmates, too, were issued masks — although he said they were the “cheap, paper kind” — and told they can wear them when they leave their cells.\n\n“A lot of the older guys are wearing them,” Pezzeca said.\n\nWith too few medical-grade masks to provide to all employees, Blackwell said the department is issuing guards and other staff cloth masks produced by inmates instead. Some members have raised concerns about the efficacy of the masks, although Blackwell said he did not have an opinion because it is too early to tell whether the protective equipment is effective.\n\nFinn said the department is following all protocols from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state Department of Health.\n\nPezzeca said he is not aware of anyone having tested positive at SCI Forest, but he said an area has been set up so that anyone displaying symptoms can be quarantined. He also said all educational and recreational time has been canceled.\n\nInmates are allowed outside for two 50-minute sessions in the afternoon and evening, during which they are being told to practice social distancing. He was worried the prison would be placed on lockdown because “that is when the violence starts.”\n\nHe’s also worried about the lack of access to antibacterial soap, which costs about $1.\n\n“Some guys can’t afford the soap from the commissary,” he said\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nFinn said inmates are producing roughly 4,000 bars each week through Pennsylvania Correctional Industries and that soap is provided free of charge.\n\nInmates, many of whom may be medically vulnerable to begin with, likely do not have access to the same level of care they would on the outside, said Shubik-Richards of the Pennsylvania Prison Society.\n\nStill, many of the measures the department has ordered — such as restricting movement within prisons — are a step in the right direction, she said, although it's unclear to what extent all facilities are able to follow the directives.\n\n\"They're being thoughtful and they're doing what they can within the constraints that they have,\" Shubik-Richards said. \"That's not to say they can't do more. I think they can do more, and they need to do more, but they are definitely working in the right direction.\"\n\nShe said state and county facilities should take measures to address stress among inmates and staff, de-escalate disputes, eliminate medical copays, and release people who are not a threat to public safety.\n\nThe department has suspended all visits through at least April 10. In their place, inmates have been offered 15 minutes of call time for free, as well as one 45-minute video visit per week.\n\nShubik-Richards said those steps help reduce stress and anxiety.\n\nBlackwell said the union has reached out to the department to request extra incentives for officers who continue to work through the pandemic, but has not heard back.\n\n“In a way, it’s good to be an ‘essential’ employee because you definitely aren't going to lose any pay or anything,” Blackwell said. “But as a corrections officer — a police officer, anybody — you worry about the risk of getting something and taking it back to your family.”\n\n<i>Spotlight PA staff writer Angela Couloumbis contributed to this story.\n\n<b>100% ESSENTIAL:</b> Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

[Sign up for Spotlight PA’s newsletter.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters)</i>\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Police on Monday will begin enforcing the statewide shutdown for [all but “life-sustaining” businesses](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inquirer.com%2Fhealth%2Fcoronavirus%2Fspl%2Fpennsylvania-shutdown-lifesustaining-businesses-tom-wolf-shut-down-20200319.html) across the state, as Gov. Tom Wolf warned that emergency measures may last longer than initially anticipated.\n\n“I want to be honest with you, and what we face,” Wolf said during an early evening briefing with reporters. “What we are trying to do here is buy time … we cannot overload our health system.”\n\nHe added: “If we aren’t successful, the consequences are going to be even more dire than the consequences that we are facing now.”\n\nIn a statement, Colonel Robert Evanchick, commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police, said “private businesses, organizations, and other noncompliant entities face possible criminal penalties.” The violations are summary offenses punishable by fines and jail time.\n\nOther agencies involved with enforcement include the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, Department of Health, Department of Agriculture, and “local officials, using their resources to enforce closure orders within their jurisdictions.\"\n\n\"Troopers and liquor control officers will make every effort to achieve voluntary compliance by educating business owners and using discretion when appropriate,” Evanchick said. \"But our message is clear: COVID-19 is a serious health and public safety risk that requires an extraordinary response from law enforcement and the public.\"\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/donate/\"></div>\n\nAsked Sunday whether he would consider implementing a stay-at-home directive, similar to what Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced, Wolf said: “That is something that has to be under consideration. And it is for Pennsylvania.”\n\nWhen asked about whether he would delay reopening schools — which currently are set to reopen the week of March 30th — the governor said he will be making the decision this week.\n\nBut he also warned it could take more time to reach the point where life will return to normal.\n\n“We all need to change the way we live our lives,” he said. “We will have to do that for a period of time so that we can emerge safe and healthy.”\n\n“When this time is over,” he added, “we’ll need an even greater effort to get ourselves back on our feet -- and back on our feet will mean something different than it did three weeks ago.\"\n\nThe Democratic governor also said he is in talks with the state legislature to postpone the April 28th primary, although no agreement has been reached.\n\nSince Saturday, there have been 108 new cases of COVID-19 reported. The statewide total is 479 people in 33 counties.\n\nApproximately 47 — or about 10% — of those infected have required hospitalization since March 6, state Health Secretary Rachel Levine said.\n\n\"Our data so far indicates that approximately 4% of cases have required intensive care and approximately 2% have required ventilators,\" Levine said.\n\nLevine said tests are available not only through the state but through commercial labs including Quest. She reiterated that people with no or mild symptoms should not seek a test, although they can contact their health provider.\n\n\"I don’t see a time when we’ll be testing asymptomatic people in the future,” she said.\n\n<b><i>100% ESSENTIAL:</b> Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

[Get the latest information here.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-coronavirus-life-sustaining-wolf-mandatory-shutdown-order-full-list/)***\n\nHARRISBURG — On March 16, Gov. Tom Wolf [ordered a statewide shutdown](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-coronavirus-statewide-shutdown-tom-wolf-governor/), urging nonessential businesses to close for two weeks to help slow the spread of the coronavirus in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe governor also ordered restaurants and bars to close their dine-in facilities and to limit service to carry-out or delivery.\n\nBut Wolf’s move has caused confusion among business owners and the wider public about what is considered a nonessential business, and whether his shutdown is voluntary or mandatory.\n\n*Here’s what we know as of 6 p.m. March 18 (this story will be updated):*\n\n## Q: What is an essential business?\n\nA: The state has not provided a comprehensive list, but did release the following [guidance](https://dced.pa.gov/resources/) on “essential services and sectors”:\n\n* Food processing\n* Agriculture\n* Industrial manufacturing\n* Feed mills\n* Construction\n* Trash collection\n* Grocery and household goods (including convenience stores)\n* Home repair/hardware and auto repair\n* Pharmacy and other medical facilities\n* Biomedical and healthcare\n* Post offices and shipping outlets\n* Insurance\n* Banks\n* Gas stations\n* Laundromats\n* Veterinary clinics and pet stores\n* Warehousing, storage, and distribution\n* Public transportation\n* Hotel and commercial lodging\n\n***» DONATE NOW: Spotlight PA reporters are working nonstop under difficult circumstances to provide journalism for the public good. Our work is reader-funded, and we need your help.[Make a donation now](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate).***\n\n## Q: What is a nonessential business?\n\nA: The state has again provided guidance, rather than a comprehensive list. “Public-facing” businesses are urged to close for two weeks. Any business owner with questions is asked to email [ra-dcedcs@pa.gov](mailto:ra-dcedcs@pa.gov).\n\nThese businesses include:\n\n* Entertainment facilities\n* Hospitality facilities\n* Recreation facilities, like community centers\n* Gyms, including yoga, barre, and spin studios\n* Hair salons, barbershops, nail salons, and spas\n* Casinos\n* Concert venues\n* Theaters\n* Sporting event venues, including golf courses\n* Retail facilities, like shopping malls; retail shops with pharmacies or other health care facilities can continue to operate\n\n## Q: Are nonessential businesses required to close?\n\nA: This is the primary source of confusion.\n\nThe administration said in a news release on March 17 that it “is relying on businesses to act now before the governor or the Secretary of Health finds it necessary to compel closures under the law for the interest of public health.”\n\nWolf’s advisers say he’s [empowered to do so](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-tom-wolf-emergency-powers-pennsylvania/).\n\n“The administration supports local law enforcement, permitting entities, and local officials to enforce if needed,” the state [said](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-puts-statewide-covid-19-mitigation-efforts-in-effect-stresses-need-for-every-pennsylvanian-to-take-action-to-stop-the-spread/) on March 16. “The governor does not want to expend valuable resources from the state police and PA National Guard because irresponsible people choose not to do the right thing.”\n\nRepublican leaders in the state House put out their own message.\n\nThey said in a statement that although they agree large groups should not gather, “if you, or a business owner you know, wish to remain in business, it is their right to do so.”\n\nWhen asked if the GOP leaders' message was correct, Lyndsay Kensinger, a spokesperson for Wolf, said \"no.\"\n\n“\\[State House leadership] should encourage all of their constituents to follow the guidance by the Wolf Administration and the federal government to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19,\" Kensinger said.\n\n## Q: What about restaurants and bars?\n\nA: Wolf has “[temporarily prohibited](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/wolf-administration-updates-businesses-on-guidance-for-covid-19-mitigation-efforts/)” restaurants and bars from serving patrons sit-down meals, but they can continue to offer takeout, drive-through, or delivery options.\n\nOn March 18, the administration said it would begin cracking down on restaurants and bars that continue to offer dine-in services. The Liquor Control Board said it is mandating all on-premises consumption of food and alcohol stop and the State Police will cite and suspend violators.\n\n“Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures, and this decision is not made lightly,\" control board chairman Tim Holden said. “But saving lives and protecting the health and safety of our communities is our highest priority right now.”\n\nJohn Longstreet, president of the Pennsylvania Restaurant & Lodging Association, said he trusts public health officials and said he is focused on making sure small businesses survive the pandemic.\n\n“We are focused on recovery and making sure employees have access to benefits, restaurants have cash flow to reopen, and that they survive this economic break,” he said, later adding: “The vast majority of people I‘ve talked to are glad the government is doing its job.”\n\n## Q: What about schools?\n\nOn March 13, Wolf ordered all K-12 schools statewide to close. Still, some private and higher-education institutions continued to operate, requiring students to report to class if they did not have flu-like symptoms.\n\nAs of March 17, however, Eric Levis, a spokesperson for the state Department of Education, said private schools and colleges “are affected” by the statewide shutdown request. More details are available on the [department’s website](https://www.education.pa.gov/Schools/safeschools/emergencyplanning/COVID-19/Pages/AnswersToFAQs.aspx).\n\n## Q: What about child care providers?\n\nA: Child care facilities statewide have been shuttered.\n\nBut facilities that serve the children of essential employees like health care workers and first responders can submit a waiver through the Department of Human Services’ Office of Child Development and Early Learning by emailing *[RA-PWDRACERT@pa.gov](mailto:RA-PWDRACERT@pa.gov).*\n\nCommunities can also implement programs for school-age children to support families that have to work. These “part-day school-age programs” do not need to be licensed to operate, but they must comply with background check requirements.\n\nAdditional guidance can be found on the [department’s website](https://www.dhs.pa.gov/providers/Providers/Pages/Coronavirus-Provider-Resources.aspx).\n\n## Q: What about everything else?\n\n* All casinos are closed.\n* All driver’s license and photo centers are closed. The Department of Transportation has extended the validity of expiring driver’s licenses, vehicle registrations, and inspections until the end of April.\n* State-run liquor stores will close indefinitely at 9 p.m. March 17, although consumers can still purchase wine and beer at grocery stores that carry them, according to officials at the Liquor Control Board.\n* All facilities at state parks and forests are closed for 14 days starting March 17. Trails, lakes, forests, roads, and parking areas will remain open to the public.\n* Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court is under a statewide judicial emergency until April 14, 2020, during which county president judges can, among other changes, restrict or temporarily close court facilities and authorize using technology to conduct court proceedings.\n* The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission has stopped accepting cash or credit cards as payment at tollbooths to keep drivers moving. Payments will be assessed through E-ZPass or the “toll by plate” program.\n* All 17 service plazas along the Turnpike will be [partially closed](https://www.paturnpike.com/Press/2020/20200317150606.htm), meaning there will be no fast food or inside dining available. Indoor restrooms will also be closed, but portable toilets are still an option. Gas stations and convenience stores will still operate.\n* The state’s Department of Corrections is not allowing visitors and is screening all staff, vendors, contractors, and incarcerated persons for COVID-19 symptoms.\n* No visitors are allowed inside senior care or long-term care facilities.\n* All County Assistance Offices are closed until at least April 1.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=%3Cb%3EHave%20a%20question%20or%20tip%20about%20Pennsylvania's%20shutdown%3F%3C%2Fb%3E%20We%20want%20to%20hear%20from%20you.\"></div>\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

That includes tours, school field trips, and rallies.\n\nYet lawmakers in the state House and Senate are still planning to meet next week — although legislative leaders signaled those plans are fluid.\n\n“The coronavirus situation changes daily,” the top Republican and Democratic senators said in a joint statement Thursday, adding: “Evaluation of circumstances are ongoing and changes to Senate operations will be made if necessary.”\n\nStill, some lawmakers were bristling at having to convene in Harrisburg, even as Gov. Tom Wolf encouraged suspending gatherings with more than 250 people.\n\nThere are more than 250 lawmakers in the Capitol, and the legislature employs hundreds of staffers on top of that.\n\n“Reconvening the #PAHouse for legislative session next week is an aggressively bad idea,” state Rep. Chris Rabb (D., Philadelphia) wrote in a tweet Thursday.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Right now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PAHouse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PAHouse</a> is still scheduled to report to session Monday.

Already, several lawmakers have circulated bills to address everything from ensuring the public can vote safely in elections to suspending testing in public schools in the midst of the public health crisis.\n\nOn the Senate side, lawmakers are heeding advice from the state health department and have measures in place should lawmakers need to work remotely.\n\n“In the event of a closure or quarantine, we have taken measures to ensure that essential staff and senators will be able to work remotely and continue all core functions of the Senate,” said Brittany Crampsie, spokesperson for Democrats in the chamber.\n\nFive senators instructed their staff to work remotely as of Thursday afternoon, she said, including lawmakers from Philadelphia, Bucks, Montgomery, and Delaware Counties — all areas with at least one COVID-19 infection.\n\nAll state employees who work or live in Montgomery County have been told to work from home, Wolf said Thursday.\n\nThe state House is communicating with other state agencies to monitor the situation and “working to ensure every decision we make is in the best interest of public health,” said Mike Straub, spokesperson for House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler (R., Lancaster).\n\n“At this time, we have not made any changes to session schedule, or for policies regarding our members and district staff,” Straub said.\n\nHouse members cannot vote remotely, but they can place themselves on leave if they think it is necessary, Straub added. The chamber has “passed temporary rules in the past to allow ill members to vote from home,” he said, and “those kinds of rule changes are being discussed at this time.\"\n\nSuch a change would require a vote on the House floor.\n\nSenators can still cast votes on bills even when they aren’t in the Capitol — they have to take what is called “<a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/pennsylvania/225681191.html\">legislative leave</a>,” meaning they are working in their districts or are traveling between Harrisburg and their district.\n\nBill Patton, a spokesperson for House Democrats, said he looks forward to Monday’s session, when Philadelphia <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/clout/special-election-190th-district-west-philadelphia-roni-green-movita-johnson-harrell-20200226.html\" target=_blank>special election winner</a> Roni Green will be sworn in as a representative.\n\n“House leaders are monitoring developments and asking legislators, staff, and Capitol visitors to follow the Department of Health’s guidance, notably on washing hands,” he said.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=Do%20you%20have%20a%20tip%20about%20%3Cb%3Ehow%20Pa.'s%20government%20is%20handling%20the%20coronavirus%3C%2Fb%3E%3F%20Tell%20us%20now.%20\"></div>\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

Bucks County and Philadelphia, which also operate their own health departments and could hand out more details, have chosen not to.\n\nBucks County Health Department Director David Damsker said Wednesday that there was no public health reason to release the locations of the county’s two coronavirus patients.\n\n\"The state prefers that we don't, but we’re doing it for our own reasons,\" Damsker said, adding that the county would release more details if there were a reason to do so.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nPennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Wednesday counties with local departments “have complete control” about what information they release.\n\n“They have a decision to make whether giving out specific information supports the public’s health,” Levine said. “If that health official feels it is necessary for the public health, then they can release it.\"\n\nBut there are only 10 counties and municipalities with local health departments. That has left officials in areas that lack a local department — and the public — in the dark about specifics.\n\nDelaware County lawmakers and officials say they have pressed the state department for the exact municipality where the county’s infected person lives, and lawmakers were on multiple phone calls with the state over the weekend.\n\n“We tried to push them as much as possible,” Monica Taylor, vice chair of the Delaware County Council, said on Monday. “They are not budging at all.”\n\nState officials told the county council that the 1955 public health law “prohibits the state from releasing identifying information about a patient unless there is an imminent threat,” said Adrienne Marofsky, a spokesperson for Delaware County.\n\nDelaware County state Sens. Tom Killion, a Republican, and Tim Kearney, a Democrat, urged the state to release information that would help the county’s emergency response without putting the patient’s privacy at risk.\n\n“[T]his information is being withheld from our professional and effective county emergency services personnel,” the lawmakers said in a statement. “This information serves the interest of public safety and transparency without substantially infringing on this individual’s right to privacy.”\n\nThough anyone who had direct contact with the infected person has been notified by officials, a spokesperson for Kearney said residents want more information.\n\n“We don’t know whether it’s one end of the county or the other end,” Kearney spokesperson Taj Magruder said. “Without a county health department, the state essentially owns the information. Otherwise this would be information that would be shared with a county health department that could be shared with the general public.”\n\nNate Wardle, a health department spokesperson, said the state is “providing those counties with the information that they need to know.”\n\n“Residents of those counties can be assured that contact tracing” — the public health term used for interviewing people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus — “is occurring, and anyone who may have come into contact with one of these individuals would have been contacted,” Wardle said.\n\nOfficials in Wayne County, which does not have a local health department, said they don’t have details about the county’s one coronavirus case either, but trust the state to do its job.\n\n“We did ask them for specifics — if they could tell us even a region of the county, if they had children in a school district,” said Andrew Seder, chief clerk for the county commissioners.\n\nBut commissioners said they were happy with the state’s response.\n\n“We understand confidentiality issues across the board, so we just don’t push back, but we did feel as though the state was fairly good about getting a hold of us,” Wayne Commissioner Brian Smith said Monday.\n\nIn Philadelphia, county health officials have not made public the neighborhood where the city’s one infected person lives. They say they are working with the state on COVID-19 efforts on a daily basis.\n\n“We manage and track Philadelphia residents and are in direct contact with them as needed, so we have no issues there,” said James Garrow, the communications director for the city’s public health department.\n\nOn Wednesday, the state health department released for the first time the number and results of samples tested, as well as the number of people under investigation after coming into contact with an infected person.\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, 22 people had tested positive and 116 had tested negative. There were 81 samples pending and 219 people under investigation.\n\nThe department “wanted to ensure that the right to privacy of Pennsylvanians was protected,” health spokesperson Wardle said, but since more than 100 samples had been tested, “we felt we could get the information out.”\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=Do%20you%20have%20info%20about%20how%20%3Cb%3EPa.'s%20government%20is%20responding%20to%20the%20coronavirus%3C%2Fb%3E%3F%20Let%20us%20know.\"></div>\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters\"><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nHARRISBURG — More than five years ago, Pennsylvania identified widespread problems with its system of appointing and overseeing guardians — the legal decision-makers, chosen by judges, who manage the affairs of adults who are unable to care for themselves.\n\nIn response, the state Supreme Court established an office to oversee the implementation of 130 sweeping recommendations made by experts in the field. An update from 2019 noted significant progress, marking more than half as “accomplished.”\n\nBut a Spotlight PA review found the report paints an overly rosy picture of the situation. Experts say that critical changes needed to better protect vulnerable seniors lack funding, are incomplete, or are stuck in limbo in the state legislature.\n\nOf the recommendations marked as “accomplished,” many were not actually put into practice, the review found. One of those recommendations — to guarantee legal counsel to people who might be put in the care of a guardian — has been at least temporarily shelved.\n\nOther reforms marked accomplished will be included as “best practices” in a new guidebook for judges who handle guardianship cases. The book, still in draft form, was originally slated to be published in early 2019, but is now expected this summer.\n\nThe “most significant accomplishment,” the update said, was the rollout of a highly touted technology to collect data about guardianships and to automate portions of oversight. One year later, however, there is little consistency as to how, and how well, counties are using it.\n\nOther recommendations are caught in stalled legislation or unfunded mandates.\n\n“Having protection systems that function properly is a bipartisan, commonwealth-wide issue,” said Katherine Pearson, a professor of elder law at Penn State’s Dickinson Law School, who served on the task force that drafted the recommendations. \"Am I frustrated with the Pennsylvania legislature’s slowness to address and adopt carefully considered reforms, such as a clear right to counsel for alleged incapacitated persons? Yes.\"\n\nThose involved with the guardianship system — from judges to court clerks to attorneys — say they are impressed with the state’s efforts to bolster protections in recent years. Court officials are committed to improving the new tracking and oversight technology, and nearly all agree the data it provides will offer crucial insights into the system.\n\n“It’s a huge step in the right direction,” said Kathryn Holt, a senior court research analyst for the National Center for State Courts. From a national perspective, Holt said, she has been “very impressed” with Pennsylvania’s progress.\n\nBut a lot of work remains.\n\nStewart Greenleaf, a former Republican lawmaker from Montgomery County, spent years attempting to pass sweeping changes to the system. But he was unable to get a bill establishing better guardianship protocols for courts to the governor’s desk before retiring in 2018.\n\nThe legislative process takes time, Greenleaf said.\n\n“It’s as simple as that,” he said. “That it’s not that simple.”\n\nAround the time of Greenleaf’s retirement, Sen. Art Haywood (D., Philadelphia) announced his intention to reintroduce and update the bill, but more than a year later, he still hasn’t. He said he can’t find bipartisan support.\n\nAsked where Pennsylvania’s guardianship system stands now, Haywood responded with one word: “Stuck.”\n\n{{<picture src=\"2020/03/01f6jb1me9mbpzen.jpeg\" caption=\"Sen. Art Haywood (D., Philadelphia) said further reforms to Pennsylvania's guardianship system are “stuck” in the legislature and lack bipartisan support.\" credit=\"Commonwealth Media Services\" description=\"Sen. Art Haywood (D., Philadelphia) said further reforms to Pennsylvania's guardianship system are “stuck” in the legislature and lack bipartisan support.\">}}\n\n# ‘We need to appoint counsel’\n\nIn Pennsylvania, there are about 18,400 adults living under guardianship. More than half are age 60 and up.\n\nGuardianships begin when someone is perceived to be unable to care for themselves. If they do not have an existing legal document describing their preferences, like a durable power of attorney, their case is sent to the local Orphans’ Court. There, a judge can appoint a guardian to take control of financial, medical, and personal decisions.\n\nUnlike many states, Pennsylvania does not require that courts provide lawyers to represent people facing guardianship. Vulnerable seniors who cannot find or afford an attorney can be left to navigate the process alone.\n\n“It’s stressful for courts,” said Karen Buck, executive director of SeniorLAW Center in Philadelphia and a member of the task force that made the recommendations. Judges cannot give legal advice, and without representation, Buck said, people might not be aware of their rights.\n\nIn 2014, the task force <a href=\"http://media-downloads.pacourts.us/eltf-report.pdf?cb=1579202701205\">recommended</a> changing court rules to make legal representation a requirement.\n\nBut the Orphans’ Court rules committee dismissed the recommendation, instead deciding that appointment of attorneys, in cases where someone doesn’t provide their own, should be left to a court’s discretion. In a notice, the committee <a href=\"http://www.pacourts.us/assets/uploads/Resources/Documents/Republication%20Notice%20Report%20Rule%20Appendix%20and%20Form%20regarding%20Guardianship%20Expert%20Report%20-%20006317.pdf?cb=16449\">cited</a> concerns about the financial burden and added that “a large majority” of guardianship cases go uncontested.\n\nHaywood, who was previously an attorney for people who could not afford legal representation, said the committee’s analysis doesn’t cut it.\n\n“Failure to contest is not an indication of the lack of the need for legal representation,” he said. “In fact, it can be conceived as the exact opposite.”\n\nStill, the recommendation to mandate counsel was <a href=\"http://www.pacourts.us/assets/files/page-1240/file-7546.pdf?cb=1582926263889\">marked</a> as “accomplished.”\n\nCherstin Hamel is the director of the state’s Office of Elder Justice in the Courts, which is overseeing the implementation of the 130 recommendations. She said that if a recommendation was considered, but not adopted, it was marked as “accomplished.”\n\nHamel added the guidebook for judges will indicate that it is best practice for counsel to be appointed in every case.\n\nLawmakers could mandate the right to counsel through legislation. But according to Haywood, there has been “tremendous” pushback to the idea, primarily over “perceived costs.”\n\nSome judges have taken matters into their own hands.\n\nGeorge Zanic, president judge of the Huntingdon County Court of Common Pleas, appoints an attorney each time someone facing a guardianship hearing does not provide their own. In situations where the individual cannot cover the fees, he said, the county pays upfront and is later reimbursed by the state.\n\nAccording to Zanic, who served on the task force, the issue is vital.\n\n“We need to appoint counsel,” he said. “There’s no question about it.”\n\n{{<picture src=\"2020/03/01f6jb28pv6f67dj.jpeg\" caption=\"Old reports and docket books at the Cumberland County Orphans’ Court, which is still grappling with how to manage a new technology to monitor legal guardians.\" credit=\"Sara Simon / Spotlight PA\" description=\"Old reports and docket books at the Cumberland County Orphans’ Court, which is still grappling with how to manage a new technology to monitor legal guardians.\">}}\n\n\n# Improved oversight with a tech assist\n\nIn 2014, the task force found that nearly 70% of Orphans’ Courts did not track whether they were receiving annual updates from guardians with information about an individual’s finances, health, and well-being.\n\nThe task force recommended a new technology that could automatically notify Orphans’ Courts when guardians failed to file required updates. An algorithm would also search across those reports and trigger automated alerts when something seemed amiss.\n\nBy December 2018, the new technology was in place across Pennsylvania, and one year in, many who interact with it say the tool is progress.\n\n“I really like it,” said Lauren Cascino Presser, an elder law attorney in Johnstown, who helps her clients use the technology to submit their annual reports.\n\nBut for a tool intended to ease and streamline oversight, it falls short of addressing the disparities in how counties are monitoring guardianships.\n\nOnce a guardian submits a report, the tool automatically searches for 32 problem scenarios. The majority are related to finances. A report showing a drastic drop in assets, for example, triggers an automated flag.\n\nBut flags don’t directly imply wrongdoing. They require follow-up to determine whether harm is being done and what action, if any, should be taken.\n\nIn some counties, court staff is tasked with reviewing the incoming flags. In others, law clerks do the work. Some counties have outsourced the job to outside attorneys. One, so overwhelmed by the scale of alerts, said they recently tapped a retired judge to step in and assist.\n\nBy comparison, Minnesota has a similar tool that sends alerts to centralized teams of trained auditors.\n\n“Any system is only as good as the people running it,” said Zanic, the judge in Huntingdon County.\n\nPennsylvania’s new technology is also susceptible to an old problem: bad actors.\n\nGuardians are self-reporting and are not required to provide bank statements, receipts, or other documentation. And reports can only reveal so much, said Sherry Baskin, a longtime volunteer helping to monitor Dauphin County’s guardians.\n\n“Unless there was something egregious and glaring, that wouldn’t be reflected,” Baskin said.\n\nOne benefit of the new system, many agree, is that when courts have questions, they can order guardians to submit evidence or appear for a hearing. Prior to the tool, court officials said, they lacked the authority to follow a hunch.\n\nIt’s when courts can’t keep up, though, that issues creep in.\n\nAlerts arrive daily in Philadelphia, courts spokesperson Gabriel Roberts said.\n\nThey come not only for every flag raised in a file, Roberts said, but also for reminder notices and for reports that are overdue. There are flags for guardians removed from a case and flags for people who have died. Staff resources are “stressed and overwhelmed,” Roberts said.\n\nWhen asked in January how Cumberland County is managing the tool’s alerts, Lisa Grayson, clerk of the county’s Orphans’ Court, said: “We’re still working that out.”\n\n“You need to review the entire report,” Grayson said.\n\nBut, she added, that “takes manpower, it takes hours, it takes money.”\n\nHamel, the director of the office overseeing reforms, said the tool is “meant to enhance a court’s existing statutory obligation to monitor guardianships,” and that the office is “actively working to recommend best practices in reviewing reports.”\n\nStill, her office has marked two recommendations for adequate funding to support guardianship monitoring as “accomplished,” citing the new technology.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=Do%20you%20have%20a%20tip%20about%20%3Cb%3EPennsylvania%E2%80%99s%20guardianship%20system%3C%2Fb%3E%3F%20Let%20us%20know.\"></div>\n\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "When the legislature wrote Pennsylvania’s open records law in 2008, it was hailed as a win for the public, greatly expanding access to a wider array of government records.\n\nLess noticed at the time was that lawmakers largely exempted themselves from having to reveal many records that other government agencies routinely have to make public.\n\nWant access to a legislator’s emails? A log of who lawmakers meet with and why? Who they talked to on the phone? You’re out of luck.\n\nAside from voting calendars, bills, and public hearing minutes and transcripts, financial documents are among the few records the legislature is required to disclose.\n\nBut as The Caucus and Spotlight PA have recently discovered, [lawmakers are trying to shield portions of those records as well.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-senate-finance-budget-public-open-records/)\n\n***» RELATED:** [Pa.

It has been a long one — the first round of public records requests were filed in November of last year — and it is far from over.\n\nIt could be months before all of the records are turned over.

Tom Wolf announced Friday.\n\nWolf has signed an emergency disaster declaration “to provide increased support to state agencies involved in the response,\" according to a statement.\n\n“It’s imperative that we continue to respond quickly and accurately to the coronavirus and its introduction into Pennsylvania,” Wolf said.\n\nThe cases of COVID-19, in Delaware County and Wayne County, still need to be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The affected people, who are adults, have been quarantined in their homes.\n\n“I want to emphasize we all should remain calm here,” Wolf told reporters Friday. “I can assure you that our state government will continue to function smoothly as we respond to this public health issue.”\n\nRachel Levine, secretary of the state Department of Health, said the cases were not transmitted in the community, but were from travel. One affected adult had been in Europe, while the other “recently traveled to an area of the United States where COVID-19 is present.”\n\nOfficials announced earlier in the week that the state lab in Exton is now [testing](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-coronavirus-testing-state-labs/) COVID-19 samples. As of Friday, the lab can handle between 20 and 25 samples a day. By the weekend, the lab will be able to do 125 to 150 assessments a day, according to Levine.\n\n“We are prepared,” Levine said, later adding there is no testing backlog.\n\nUnder the emergency declaration, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency has been authorized to assume all statewide emergency operations, direct agencies, and use all available resources and personnel \"as is deemed necessary to cope with this emergency situation,” Wolf said in a statement.\n\nWhile five schools in Bucks County were closed Friday after students and staff attended an event with a person diagnosed with COVID-19, Levine said “there are no confirmed cases\" in the county.\n\nLevine said Pennsylvanians should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds, not touch their faces, clean surfaces, and stay home if sick to protect themselves from the virus. Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

But on Thursday, they backed off that position and restored dozens of spending details and promised to turn over hundreds more in the coming weeks.\n\nRepublican leaders will also propose a new House rule that would narrow the scope of redactions in the future, said Jake Smeltz, chief of staff for House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler (R., Lancaster).\n\n“We are open and transparent about our expenditures,” House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) tweeted Thursday, a day after his office hand-delivered copies of some of his expenses without blacked-out details.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nThe Caucus and Spotlight PA sought thousands of records as part of an ongoing effort to document how the nation’s largest full-time legislature spends about $360 million in taxpayer money it receives each year.\n\nIn making many of the redactions, the House drew on an obscure provision in the state Constitution aimed at giving lawmakers wide latitude on speech on the House floor. It was designed to give them immunity from defamation suits in official proceedings, but the legislature had applied it to a larger “sphere” of their day-to-day duties.\n\nThe Senate is still taking that position.\n\nNewly unredacted documents provided by the House show it had shielded spending details, even for routine lawmaker duties.\n\nFor example, a $180 charge out of the speaker’s account in May 2017 was first described as, “Breakfast meeting with \\[REDACTED] to discuss \\[REDACTED].” It turns out, the hidden portion was that Turzai had met with the “Lancaster Delegation” to discuss “legislative priorities and events in Members’ districts.”\n\nAnother one about a $73.31 breakfast meeting during state budget negotiations redacted who top staffers had met with and what they discussed. The unredacted reports revealed the staffers had met with “Senate leadership” to discuss “voting calendar for the week of 6/5/2017.”\n\nMany rank-and-file GOP lawmakers told The Caucus they did not know some of their expenses were being blacked out and some complained to leadership in recent days.\n\n“When it comes to anything I’m doing where I’m getting reimbursed by the state, absolutely, you guys should have the right to know it,” said Rep. Cris Dush (R., Jefferson County). “And the public should too.”\n\nThe news organizations are still challenging redactions in the Senate, which also has taken the unusual step of [scrubbing details](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-senate-finance-budget-public-open-records/) about thousands of expenses in response to an open records request.\n\nSen. Lindsey Williams (D., Allegheny) said she was “livid” about the removal of the details and took the extra step of posting all her expense reports on her <a href=\"https://www.senatorlindseywilliams.com/expenses/\" target=_blank>website</a>. Williams said in a statement Thursday she “was not consulted about what if any redactions should be made.”\n\nSenate open records officers “instead made their decision to exert their definition of legislative privilege on my behalf allegedly to protect me,” Williams said. “Who are they really protecting by unilaterally redacting public information?”\n\n“Members of the General Assembly should be completely transparent with how taxpayers dollars are spent,” said Williams.\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters\"><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nHARRISBURG — Top officials with the Pennsylvania Senate scrubbed thousands of detailed explanations about its expenses from official records provided to two news organizations, raising alarm among open records and good-government advocates.\n\nIn turning over the documents, requested by The Caucus and Spotlight PA, Senate officials did not black out the explanations, but instead edited them out, making it appear as though they never existed. The officials also did not disclose that they had removed the information.\n\n“You can’t just delete things from public records,” said Terry Mutchler, the first director of the state’s Office of Open Records and a prominent First Amendment lawyer. “It is absolutely flabbergasting. It’s a new level of anti-transparency. We are now in the anti-transparency Olympics.”\n\nThe records were requested as part of an ongoing effort to document exactly how the nation’s largest full-time legislature spends the roughly $360 million in taxpayer money it receives each year, including more than $100 million allocated to the Senate.\n\nDonetta D’Innocenzo, the Senate’s chief clerk and open records officer, did not return calls or emails seeking comment about how or why the information was removed.\n\nMichael Sarfert, the Senate’s open records lawyer, said in an email that the chamber removed the spending details because the news organizations did not specifically state that they wanted to know the “purpose” of the Senate’s expenditures. The news organizations asked for all expenses, from all Senate accounts.\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\" data-analytics-label=\"pa-senate-redactions\" id=\"pa-senate-redactions__graphic\" data-iframe-fallback=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/pa-senate-redactions/fallback-mobile.jpg\" data-iframe-fallback-width=\"350\" data-iframe-fallback-height=\"594\" data-iframe=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/pa-senate-redactions/index.html\" data-iframe-height=\"594\" data-iframe-resizable></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">(function() { var l = function() { new pym.Parent( 'pa-senate-redactions__graphic', 'https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/pa-senate-redactions/index.html'); }; if(typeof(pym) === 'undefined') { var h = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0], s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = 'https://pym.nprapps.org/pym.v1.min.js'; s.onload = l; h.appendChild(s); } else { l(); } })(); </script>\n\nPennsylvania’s open records law requires government agencies to search for all records that are relevant to a request. The law exempts certain records from release and allows government agencies to black out, or redact, portions of documents.\n\nThe law does not, however, appear to give agencies the authority to erase information without disclosing it. A bill pending in the House would make it a third-degree felony to alter government documents after a public records request has been made.\n\nRep. Cris Dush (R., Jefferson), the sponsor of the legislation, said it would “absolutely” prevent the Senate and other government agencies from scrubbing information.\n\n“If they’re producing a record, then the record in full should be subject to the law,” he said.\n\nThe information deleted from Senate documents included details on the purpose of the chamber’s expenses, including travel, meetings, conferences, and other outings by senators and their staffers, as well as other top officers in the chamber.\n\nInitially, Senate officials blacked out some of those details, arguing they were <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/02/pennsylvania-lawmakers-spending-blocking-details/\">subject to “legislative privilege”</a> and did not have to be disclosed to the public. The news organizations appealed and eventually submitted a new request for many of the same records. This time, however, Senate officials simply erased information rather than redact it, giving the impression it was never part of the official record.\n\nFor instance, a January 2018 expense for $60 incurred by the Senate’s then-top lawyer, Drew Crompton, was originally described as: “Parking &amp; tolls, Overnight Parking, Washington D.C. - attend meeting on \\[REDACTED].”\n\nIn the new set of records, it became just “Parking &amp; tolls.”\n\nIn another instance, a staffer’s $27.27 lunch charge in August 2018 was described as “Legislative meals, Lunch, Bellefonte, to attend the \\[REDACTED].” In the new documents, it was described merely as “Legislative meals.”\n\nOther seemingly trivial details that hadn’t been redacted originally were also removed. For example: The original documents showed a staffer charged $3 for “Other travel expenses, Gratuities, Maid service.”\n\nThe new documents erased the description, listing it simply as “Other travel expenses.”\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nSenate officials did not answer questions about whether they made the edits to the original documents, or just to copies of records turned over in response to the news organizations' request.\n\nThe news organizations requested access to the entire database used to track the Senate’s spending. But officials refused, contending they are not required to give the public access to data or records that would “subject them to alteration or manipulation.”\n\nErik Arneson, who runs Pennsylvania’s Office of Open Records, said the agency has handled 25,000 appeals since the public records law went into effect. (The legislature answers to appeals officers it appoints, not to Arneson’s office.)\n\nHe could not recall any appeals involving records that have been scrubbed of information without an explanation.\n\n“Simply leaving it out of the response is not an appropriate way to proceed,” Arneson said.\n\nMelissa Melewsky, media law counsel for the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association, called the move “disturbing.”\n\n“If they are going to withhold information from a public record, they have to justify it — not just erase it,” Melewsky said.\n\nThe Caucus and Spotlight PA sent similar public records requests to the House of Representatives. The House turned over thousands of pages of documents, many containing redactions for information it claims is exempt from disclosure. The news organizations have appealed, arguing taxpayers have a right to know how and why the money was spent.\n\nWhen asked for additional records, the House did not edit out details, but did continue to black out portions of the records.\n\nThough the legislature passed a sweeping open records law in 2008, Pennsylvania still earns low marks for transparency and public accountability.\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity in 2015 gave the state an F in its 50-state assessment of laws and other systems in place to deter corruption. Researchers cited, in part, a lack of legislative and executive accountability. Meanwhile, lawmakers in recent years have repeatedly declined to take up bills that advocates say could improve transparency.\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "\n<i><b>Capitol Notebook by </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters\"><i>Sign up for our weekly newsletter.</i></a>\n\nHARRISBURG — State officials warned Tuesday about the unknown risks of using products that contain CBD, which remains largely unregulated despite increasing popularity.\n\nWhile proponents claim CBD derived from hemp can help ease chronic pain and anxiety, the federal government says there is little research into its benefits or potential harms.\n\nThe head of the state health department said Tuesday “there are significant concerns about the quality, safety, and the content” of CBD products found at gas stations, grocery stores, and online. Unlike items at the state’s medical marijuana dispensaries, Pennsylvania does not test or regulate these CBD products.\n\n“Our supply chain is extremely, tightly regulated,” Secretary Rachel Levine told members of the House Health Committee. “None of that is true for the hemp-derived CBD products.\"\n\nThe state has approved clinical research of CBD as part of the medical marijuana program. But there is a growing need, Levine said, for “more research about the benefits and side effects of CBD-rich medical marijuana and CBD medications from hemp.”\n\nDespite similar warnings nationwide, CBD products have exploded in popularity. That’s provided an opportunity for farmers looking for a new cash crop. Most hemp in Pennsylvania is <a href=\"https://hempindustrydaily.com/mid-atlantic-region-harvest-preview-75-of-pennsylvania-cbd-producers-lack-purchase-contracts/\">grown for CBD</a>.\n\nFred Strathmeyer, a deputy secretary with the state agriculture department, said farmers may be eager to grow hemp for CBD for “quick dollars.” But, he added, “our sustainability will be in the fiber” — which can be used in building materials, clothing, and paper— “and not the CBD.”\n\n“We are trying to create a situation where our farmers succeed,” he said. “It’s all about success.”\n\nAt the moment, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved just one CBD product for medicinal purposes. “It is currently illegal to market CBD by adding it to a food or labeling it as a dietary supplement,” according to the agency. “Some CBD products are being marketed with unproven medical claims and are of unknown quality.”\n\nNatalie Krak, a policy director for the state agriculture department, said the agency only tests hemp for its THC threshold.\n\n“We have seen a proliferation of CBD products,” Krak said. “There is no consistent federal enforcement.”\n\nRobert Rudnitsky, executive director of the pro-cannabis group PhillyNORML, said it is crucial to regulate hemp-derived CBD as it is the only option for Pennsylvanians who cannot afford a medical marijuana card.\n\n“We want complete regulation,\" he told Spotlight PA. “Do we want our family and friends to buy CBD from gas stations? There is a lot of contaminated, foreign, counterfeit gray-market hemp.”\n\nWhile not the subject of Tuesday’s hearing, some lawmakers used the opportunity to raise concerns about Gov. Tom Wolf and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman’s <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-legalize-marijuana-governor-tom-wolf-20190925.html\">support</a> for legalizing recreational cannabis.\n\n“I’ll be upfront: I was a ‘no’ on medical marijuana — not because I didn't want to see people benefit from it, but because of the way it was done,” Rep. Jerry Knowles (R., Schuylkill) said. “But what is done is done.”\n\nWith Wolf and Fetterman “hell-bent” on legalization, Knowles asked Levine if she’s concerned about what that would do to Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program.\n\n“My goal with the medical marijuana program is to keep this medically and clinically based,” Levine said. “I did not want Pennsylvania to become Venice Beach. ... We have been able to thread that needle and keep this a very medically based program for patients with serious medical conditions.”\n\nShe also noted that Wolf and Fetterman are championing marijuana legalization as a social justice issue, highlighting that many people are incarcerated for possessing small amounts.\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

Department of Health announced Wednesday that the state now has the capability to test 25 samples a day.*\n\nPennsylvania’s state lab now has the ability to test for the new coronavirus, Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Tuesday.\n\nCurrently, the Exton facility is able to process just six tests a day. “We are hoping to be able to conduct more tests a day by the end of \\[the] week,\" a Department of Health spokesperson said.\n\nThere are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, but the department had over the past month sent samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing. The state lab is “testing samples as we speak,” Levine told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe ability to test at the state lab is “extremely important,” she added. The lab can return results on the same day if a sample is received in the morning.\n\nCommercial labs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will also be able to test samples.\n\nBecause of previously limited testing, Levine said the department doesn’t know “if there’s been community spread\" in Pennsylvania. “We’ll not be surprised if we have a positive test,” she said.\n\nLevine declined to say how many people are being monitored in Pennsylvania.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, six people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19, while the number of confirmed cases exceeded 100. Worldwide, there are more than 90,000 reported cases, according to the World Health Organization, and upwards of 3,000 deaths.\n\nThe state has spent roughly $200,000 so far responding to the virus, Levine said.\n\nIf a person in Pennsylvania believes they may have COVID-19, Levine said they should contact their healthcare provider. That provider, in turn, will call the department’s command center to discuss the case with an epidemiologist and determine if testing is appropriate.\n\nTesting for COVID-19 is not a rapid test like the one health providers use to diagnose strep throat.\n\n“This will be a sample that will be collected by healthcare practitioners and then sent to the lab for testing,\" she said.\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and can appear two to 14 days after initial exposure. Older adults and people with underlying health issues — like chronic cardiac disease or other conditions that might weaken the immune system — are most at risk for serious complications from a COVID-19 infection, according to the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmedia%2Freleases%2F2020%2Ft0229-COVID-19-update.html\">CDC</a>.\n\nHealth officials are <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/face-masks-hand-washing-coronavirus-protection-20200302.html\" target=\"_blank\">recommending</a> people regularly wash their hands and avoid touching their faces.\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "In January, Gov. Tom Wolf [proposed](https://www.inquirer.com/education/tom-wolf-student-debt-plan-horse-industry-20200213.html) diverting money from a special fund to support horse racing in order to create a scholarship program for state-owned schools. So what the heck is the horse-racing fund, and why does it exist?\n\nLawmakers created the Race Horse Development Fund in 2004 as part of a package that legalized casinos. Subsidized by slot machines, the fund's stated purpose is to promote horse breeding, as well as to fund purses — total prize money distributed to winners — and horsemen’s pensions.\n\nIt’s actually one of [more than 150 such funds](https://www.budget.pa.gov/PublicationsAndReports/StatusofAppropriations/SpecialFunds/Pages/default.aspx) created by the legislature to provide dedicated money to causes like the environment, caring for the elderly, and public transit. But over the years, these funds regularly have been raided to fill budget holes or balance the books.\n\nThe state House wanted to end a protracted budget battle in 2017 by rerouting $630 million in special fund money to help fill a $2.2 billion hole, [PennLive reported](https://www.pennlive.com/politics/2017/09/house_passes_22_transfer_and_b.html). Gov. Tom Wolf eventually signed a budget that borrowed against one special fund in particular, funded by a [landmark tobacco settlement](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/state/pa-budget-deficit-borrowing-gambling-gas-drilling-tax-20171025.html).\n\nNathan Benefield is vice president of the Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank that has deemed these funds the “[shadow budget](https://www.commonwealthfoundation.org/policyblog/detail/ten-facts-about-the-shadow-budget)” and believes their \"surpluses\" should be utilized before raising taxes.\n\nHe said he doesn’t think pulling money out of the Race Horse Development Trust Fund would be that big of a deal.\n\n“I think it is overblown what the impact is,\" Benefield said. “These are certainly wealthy individuals getting those prizes.”\n\nThe horse-racing industry [disagrees](https://pennhorseracing.com/news/horse-racing-industry-says-whoa-nelly-to-wolfs-plan-to-raid-its-trust-fund-to-pay-for-college-scholarships/), and[ local farmers are raising alarm](https://papost.org/2020/02/26/at-adams-county-farm-warnings-about-gov-wolfs-proposed-200-million-cut-to-the-race-horse-industry-hes-destroying-families-in-pa/).\n\nIf lawmakers agree to pull $204 million out of the fund for the scholarship program, it wouldn’t be the first time that particular piggy bank has been raided.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the legislature [diverted](https://www.paauditor.gov/press-releases/auditor-general-depasquale-warns-pennsylvania%E2%80%99s-horse-racing-industry-in-jeopardy-due-to-diversion-of-funds-declining-revenue-millions-of-dollars-intended-for-regulation-oversight-of-racing-industry-funneled-to-other-purposes) $212 million from the Race Horse Development Trust Fund, mostly to fill budget gaps, according to an audit. But it's hardly the only victim of fiscal maneuvers.\n\nThe Motor License Fund, for example, is bankrolled by license fees and gas taxes and was meant to be used to repair state highways. Instead, it now primarily pays for the Pennsylvania State Police.\n\nIt's these kind of budget moves that just earned Pennsylvania a [failing grade](https://www.volckeralliance.org/publications/truth-and-integrity-state-budgeting-balancing-act) from a nonprofit that reviewed the budget practices of all 50 states.\n\n\"Only one state — Pennsylvania, which posted a bottom-dwelling average of D-minus — received no credit in any of the five indicators in budget maneuvers,\" the report, produced by the Volcker Alliance, stated.\n",

			"body": "\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters\"><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nHARRISBURG — The Pennsylvania legislature is attempting to shield records showing why it spends some of the roughly $360 million in taxpayer money it receives each year, citing an obscure protection it claims gives lawmakers immunity from total transparency.\n\nThe House and Senate have turned over thousands of pages of financial records in response to recent public records requests from The Caucus and Spotlight PA. But many contained vague descriptions of expenses or had redactions that made it impossible to see their purpose.\n\nThe redactions primarily concealed whom legislators were meeting with, and why.\n\nIn defending their decision to keep the information secret, legislative officials cited an obscure clause in the state constitution that they say protects lawmakers’ ability to speak and debate without retribution — a right they call the “legislative privilege.”\n\nBut good-government advocates countered that such an interpretation warped the intent of the speech and debate clause, which, they said, was meant to allow lawmakers to speak freely in official proceedings.\n\n“Seems like a huge stretch,” said David Cuillier, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Arizona and president of the National Freedom of Information Coalition. “I guess there are some seriously creative lawyers there.”\n\n<i><b>» DONATE NOW to Spotlight PA and </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate\" target=_blank><i><b>help us continue to track your tax dollars in Harrisburg</b></i></a><i><b> and hold the government accountable. We rely on your support to provide this quality journalism.</b></i>\n\nThe news organizations’ requests — covering all of the legislature’s expenses, except salaries and benefits, from 2017 through 2019 — are part of a collaborative effort to document the spending of the nation’s largest full-time legislature.\n\nThe nearly 3,000 pages of records the House and Senate have released so far included information about staff travel, meals, lodging, conference costs, and professional training. Often, descriptions for expenses were vague, making it difficult to identify who spent the money and for what purpose.\n\nOf the redactions, some were to protect personal information such as bank account numbers or home addresses. In dozens of other instances, however, legislators invoked the speech and debate privilege to black out information about whom they and their staff spent money to meet with, and the purpose of those meetings.\n\nFor instance, four charges of $95.25 each for staffers who stayed overnight in Pittsburgh say only that they “Met with [REDACTED] … and legislation to create a [REDACTED]...”\n\nA $265.49 lodging and parking charge for a onetime top Senate staffer states that he traveled in January 2018 to Washington, D.C., to “attend meetings on [REDACTED].”\n\nA lawyer for the House has argued that releasing the redacted information would “interfere with the legislature’s independence and unbalance the constitutional equilibrium among the three branches of government.”\n\nLegislators may “be less inclined to engage in the full range of legitimate legislative activities that carry a reimbursable cost, for fear that those activities might be questioned or scrutinized,” Jim Mann, a lawyer for House Republicans, wrote in a brief supporting the redactions, which The Caucus and Spotlight PA are appealing.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nThe House argues the list of protected activities for lawmakers — who earn a minimum annual salary of $90,000, with leaders earning as much as $141,000 — is lengthy: communications with constituents, internal memos, talking points for speeches, and more.\n\nOfficials in the House also say the “legislative sphere” of privileges extends to staffers or anyone who might be working on their behalf.\n\nThe constitutional clause they cite appears far less expansive.\n\n“The members of the General Assembly,” it states, “shall in all cases, except treason, felony, violation of their oath of office, and breach or surety of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the sessions of their respective Houses and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either House they shall not be questioned in any other place.”\n\nAfter The Caucus and Spotlight PA challenged some of the redactions, House lawyers restored portions of some documents, providing a glimpse into the details — many trivial — they originally had determined were subject to legislative privilege.\n\nAmong the items they revealed: that freshman legislators were regularly treated to coffee and doughnuts (although it was not stated who the legislators were). In another instance, they revealed that a legislator had bought supplies and pizza for a meeting held at a local elementary school.\n\nThey also restored information about two breakfast meetings totaling $1,623 that outgoing House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) held last year. Initially, House lawyers had blacked out whom Turzai had hosted. When they unmasked the information, it showed the speaker had met with Eagle Scouts.\n\nThe legislature has successfully invoked the clause in the past to shield records such as correspondence that could shed light on deliberations leading up to a vote or other official action. But it has not routinely been used to shield records detailing how and why the House and Senate are spending taxpayer money. House officials said they do not track how often the clause has been used as a reason to redact information.\n\nThough the legislature has largely exempted itself from the state public records law, which applies to most other government entities, financial records are among the few items that legislators are required to make public.\n\nCuillier, president of the National Freedom of Information Coalition, said legislators are notorious for “secrecy creep.”\n\n“They need to buck up, have some backbone, and be accountable,” he said.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=Do%20you%20have%20a%20tip%20about%20the%20%3Cb%3EGeneral%20Assembly%3C%2Fb%3E%20we%20should%20investigate%3F%20Tell%20us.%20\"></div>\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects that number to rise and is urging the public to act to prevent the spread of the virus, which has caused 2,700 deaths worldwide but none so far in the U.S.\n\n“We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/02/25/809318447/health-officials-warn-americans-to-start-planning-for-spread-of-coronavirus-in-u\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Tuesday.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nThe Wolf administration has activated the Department of Health’s enhanced response coordination, is monitoring symptoms of those who have recently traveled to China, is educating businesses and schools, and has updated the flu plan for coronavirus, according to a Wednesday statement.\n\n“We are not discussing the number of cases that we are monitoring,\" Levine said. \"We are following all of the CDC guidelines, but we are not going to cover specific numbers now. If there is a case of COVID-19, we will inform the public.”\n\nSymptoms of the virus can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and can appear two to 14 days after the initial exposure. Some people carry the virus and can spread it, but do not show any symptoms.\n\n“This coronavirus is somewhat more contagious than influenza and it seems it can lead to more deaths than influenza,” Levine said, noting that there is conflicting international data.\n\n\n\n\n\nLevine said the state is prepared with “stores of personal protective equipment.” If those supplies were depleted by community spread, the state would have to rely on federal supplies.\n\n“Any lab testing in Pennsylvania is done at the CDC [in Atlanta], but we at the state Department of Health have labs ready to do quality testing,” Levine said, adding that the department is waiting for the CDC to send replacement test kits<a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus-pandemic-cdc-flawed-test-pcr-undetected-cases-20200225.html\" target=_blank> to replace faulty ones.</a> The CDC has not said when new kits will arrive.\n\nThe CDC can deliver test results within 24 to 48 hours, Levine said, assuming there is no backlog.\n\nWorldwide, there are already efforts underway to create a vaccine. Scientists from Philadelphia’s Wistar Institute and Plymouth Meeting-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals are <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus-vaccine-wistar-inovio-dna-20200211.html\">working to deliver a vaccine</a> that will be ready within months, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nThe highly contagious virus has already had a chilling effect in parts of the state and has halted trips to and from China.\n\n“I would like to reassure you that the Pennsylvania Department of Health and our stakeholders are prepared for any spread of COVID-19,\" Levine said.\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "<i><b>Capitol Notebook by </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters\"><i>Sign up for our weekly newsletter.</i></a>\n\nHARRISBURG — More than a hundred people rallied in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on Tuesday, a protest organizer says, calling on Attorney General Josh Shapiro to “show mercy” by supporting more commutations.\n\nThe issue came to a head in December, when the Board of Pardons, charged with recommending commutations to Gov. Tom Wolf, voted in favor of just two cases out of more than a dozen. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who serves on the board with Shapiro, called it “one of the most dismaying days of my life.”\n\nIt was an abrupt change in a record-breaking year: Wolf granted 14 commutations in 2019, up from only one the previous year.\n\nThe protests outside Shapiro’s offices were organized by several reform organizations including the Coalition to Abolish Death by Incarceration.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We know two things: 1. ⚖️ mercy is a critical partner to justice 2. 🌧 rain can’t stop us.

That is a proven fact.”\n\nPennsylvania has the second-highest number of prisoners serving life-without-parole sentences in the U.S., according to the reform organization <a href=\"https://famm.org/wp-content/uploads/FactSheet-memos_Pennsylvania.pdf\">FAMM</a>. These sentences are mandatory for first- and second-degree murder convictions.\n\nFor this population, commutation is often the only path to life outside of prison.\n\nA commutation can only be recommended to the governor after a unanimous vote by board, which is composed of five members.\n\nThe bar was lower until 1997, when voters approved an amendment to the state Constitution to require a unanimous vote. The change was spurred by the board’s 3-to-2 recommendation to commute the sentence of Reginald McFadden, who went on to kill two people and rape another.\n\nBetween 1997 and today, the lifer population in state prisons has exploded.\n\nAccording to the state Department of Corrections, there were more than 3,000 inmates serving life sentences in 1997. Their typical age was 39. As of January 2020, there were more than 5,000 inmates serving life sentences, with an average age of 49.\n\nThere’s bipartisan support in the legislature for rolling back the change.\n\nSen. Camera Bartolotta (R., Washington) has introduced a measure to change the threshold to a 4-to-1 vote. Another proposal from Rep. Joanna McClinton (D., Philadelphia) would reinstate the 3-to-2 majority in place before the 1997 change.\n\nBoth would require an amendment to the state Constitution, a lengthy process.\n\n“When people are no longer a threat to public safety and we are housing them, it is a waste of resources,” McClinton said. “Seeing people aging, in wheelchairs, in their 70s and 80s — we need to have a process.”\n\nShapiro said in January he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PAAttorneyGen/status/1222210459643842560\">supports</a> McClinton’s proposal. A review of Board of Pardons’ records shows her measure, as opposed to Bartolotta’s, could have the greatest impact.\n\nSince Wolf took office in 2015, no recommendations have been denied by a 4-to-1 majority. There were eight cases, however, denied by a 3-to-2 vote.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nMark Singel, who voted to recommend commutation for McFadden as lieutenant governor in 1994, said the case has had a chilling effect.\n\n“We basically slammed the door on folks and took away any reasonable hope they have of ever being free. That’s not fair,” Singel said Tuesday. “There are cases that cry out for mercy and justice.”\n\nFetterman and Shapiro are both Democrats who have adopted the progressive mantle. But their board records differ significantly.\n\nIn 2019, Fetterman voted to recommend commutation 30 times, while Shapiro voted to do the same 17 times, a Pennsylvania Capital-Star <a href=\"https://www.penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/fetterman-shapiro-say-they-both-believe-in-second-chances-pardons-board-votes-tell-two-different-stories/\">analysis</a> showed.\n\nDuring his campaign for lieutenant governor, Fetterman <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/05/17/john-fetterman-pittsburghs-socialists-trump-district-democrats-some-winners-from-this-weeks-elections/\">called</a> for “substantive changes on issues like pardons.”\n\n“Many of those condemned to die in prison committed their crimes as teens, but they’re now men and women in their 60s,” Fetterman <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/board-pardons-john-fetterman-josh-shapiro-clemency-20191226.html\">wrote in December</a>. “In many of these cases, the wardens of their prisons begged for their release during public hearings and pleaded that they represent zero risk to public safety.”\n\nShapiro has previously said he considers victim statements “<a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/crime/in-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-philly-lifers-clemency-plea-hits-a-roadblock-20180301.html\">first and foremost</a>” when making a decision.\n\nHis spokesperson, Jacklin Rhoads, said Tuesday “several factors play a role,” including victim statements, the applicant’s criminal history, and “flaws and inequities in the criminal justice system.”\n\n“Each of his decisions is based solely on the facts and circumstances of each applicant’s case,” Rhoads said.\n\nThat doesn’t satisfy Rorick of the Amistad Law Project. She supports legislative solutions but wants to see Shapiro vote for commutations when Fetterman is in favor.\n\nThe decisions made by the Board of Pardons can have political consequences for elected members, Singel said, but that comes with the job.\n\n“It’s dangerous and it always has been,” Singel said. “But that’s what leadership is about. When you assume the duties of being on the Board of Pardons, you take an oath. You’re supposed to dispense your duties according to the oath of office and the Constitution. If you resign to playing safe and voting no, in my opinion, you’re violating your oath of office.”\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

Elected or appointed foot soldiers, handpicked party members, and bigwigs get the final say on who gets on the ballot.\n\nIn one special election last year, a Republican House candidate was picked by 17 members of the party — including his own father.\n\nWhile few in number, special elections come with big implications: A person elected through the process is likely to stick around for years.\n\n“You get someone elected with very low turnout — it could even be single-digit turnout — and the next time that person runs, he or she is an incumbent, and they have great advantages generally speaking,” said David Thornburgh, president and CEO of the good-government group Committee of Seventy. “You could be on a path to longtime office-holding.”\n\nFrustrated lawmakers from both parties are calling for changes to make the process more open and transparent.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\n# ‘Endemic of insiderism’\n\nOver the past decade, Pennsylvania has held 44 special elections for state House and Senate seats. Of the candidates who were elected, 31 still hold that office, according to Department of State data analyzed by Spotlight PA. Two are now in Congress.\n\nThere have been eight special elections since the current legislative session began in January 2019. After Tuesday, three more are scheduled for March, in Bucks County and Western Pennsylvania.\n\nHow special election candidates for the General Assembly are selected varies between party. State law allows Democrats and Republicans to create their own processes.\n\nFor the GOP, local committee members pick a candidate when only one county is involved. Otherwise, those members pick a small number of party voters to attend a meeting and select a candidate. In practice, the conferee selection may be made by a committee’s chair. In Lebanon County last year, this led to accusations of a “<a href=\"https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/this-was-a-sham-lebanon-co-republicans-say-party-boss-poisoned-special-election-candidate-selection/\">sham</a>” process.\n\n“Chairmen have full latitude on who they choose and zero restrictions,” said Rep. Andrew Lewis (R., Dauphin), who is drafting a bill to overhaul the process. “I think it is undemocratic and it takes power away from voters. You have less than one percent of voters picking the nominee and I just don’t think that is right.”\n\nLewis’ proposed <a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=H&SPick=20190&cosponId=31058\">legislation</a> would require special primaries, in addition to special elections. He expects opposition not only from the establishment but from members of his party concerned about the high cost of running special elections.\n\n“I am currently looking at different options to bring those costs down,” Lewis said. “We don’t want to incur costs to the taxpayer that don’t have to be there. But I think it is important enough.”\n\nA spokesperson for state Republicans said the party “is very comfortable with its process.”\n\n“Adding a special primary is going to add costs to that, where right now these conferees are done almost basically for free,” a spokesperson, Charlie O’Neill, said.\n\nThe state Democratic Party’s executive committee has the final say about special election candidates, according to its bylaws. But the party usually defers to county committee members, who vote to make a recommendation.\n\nRep. Chris Rabb (D., Philadelphia) has personal experience with the special election process.\n\nHe ran as a write-in candidate in a 2016 special after Democratic ward leaders chose Tonyelle Cook-Artis, the politically connected chief of staff to the outgoing representative.\n\n“I got destroyed on March 15. But my name was not on the ballot, so it is easy for someone else to win if you don’t have any known competitors,” Rabb said.\n\nBut Rabb did get his name on the ballot just over a month later, in the primary that was open to all registered Democrats in that district. He won in a three-person race.\n\nRabb is now pushing a <a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2019&sind=0&body=H&type=B&bn=1661\">measure</a> that would require candidates to formally file with a party chairperson, pay a fee, and make an announcement video. Most critically, his bill would require a public meeting to be held in the district.\n\n“There should be one minimum standard across all counties, across the commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Rabb said. “How do we instill confidence that who is put on the ballot is not just endemic of insiderism but is a heartfelt and substantive search?”\n\nHe added that his bill “does not advantage one party over another.”\n\n“This does not do anything but level the playing field \\[and] provide greater scrutiny and involvement in a process that needs to be overhauled,” he said.\n\nThe process of deciding a party’s candidate in a special election is already convoluted and confusing to voters, Thornburgh said. But the unique power given to Democratic district, or ward, leaders in Philadelphia makes the process even murkier.\n\n“The Philadelphia suburban counties take a vote of the committee people. In Philadelphia county, that tends to not be the case. They don't often have open votes,” he said. “A couple of insiders pick the nominee without consulting committee people in any kind of public or democratic way.”\n\n# Expensive, opaque — and unlikely to change\n\nIdeally, special elections are a rarity. They are expensive — in Philadelphia, each <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/clout/mike-turzai-pennsylvania-special-elections-costs-20200110.html\">costs taxpayers</a> about $175,000 — and temporarily leave residents without an elected official.\n\nThey also effectively rob voters in districts with a strong party majority of a say in the process, Lewis noted.\n\n“A lot of these districts are either heavy Republican or heavy Democrat, so a lot of these elections are truly decided in the primary,” Lewis said.\n\nBut Christopher Nicholas, a veteran Republican consultant, contends that special elections are just that — “special situations where you lean on the parties to find the nominees.”\n\n“To me, the most important thing is getting that seat filled so people in that district have their equal representation in Harrisburg or Washington,” he said.\n\nNicholas said that challengers can always take on the winner of the special in the next primary election.\n\n“Oftentimes, when you have special elections, all sorts of people run and everybody who loses complains,” Nicholas said. “At the next regularly scheduled election for that district, it is nothing. It is a big nothingburger.”\n\nThe state Democratic Party declined to comment on its special election process or possible reforms.\n\nO’Neill, the GOP party spokesperson, said the Democratic process “is vastly different from ours.”\n\n“We are not very fond of it,” O’Neill said of his counterpart’s system.\n\nWhile Lewis has yet to formally introduce his measure, Rabb’s bill has been in the House State Government Committee since <a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/bill_history.cfm?syear=2019&sind=0&body=H&type=B&bn=1661\">June 2019</a>. And that’s where it will likely stay, according to one good-government advocate.\n\n“Special election laws are sent to committee to die,” said Eric Epstein, a former General Assembly candidate. “\\[T]hat is because neither party is going to unilaterally disarm and make the process more open, transparent, or competitive. These are gerrymandered districts and both parties are going to preserve the status quo.”\n\n<i>Spotlight PA receives funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "Your state government spent upwards of $80 billion last fiscal year. If you want to know more about where your tax dollars went and who received them, that gets a bit tricky.\n\nYou can dig into government contracts and their price tags through an [online search tool](https://www.patreasury.gov/transparency/e-library/) maintained by the state treasurer’s office. But what you might not know is that the database is missing an untold number of contracts.\n\nThat's because, while government agencies are required by law to upload contracts worth at least $5,000, the law has no teeth, there's nothing that forces those agencies to comply, and, sometimes, they don't.\n\nIn this case, transparency is optional.\n\nWe at Spotlight PA encountered the loophole several weeks ago while seeking details about a [purchase of nearly $160,000](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/01/pennsylvania-inspector-general-watchdog-waste-guns-ammo/) in guns and related equipment — since relegated to storage — by the state inspector general’s office.\n\nA spokesperson for the office confirmed the purchase and the fact that its employees cannot legally carry the weapons. But the expenditure was nowhere to be found on the [treasurer’s office e-Library](https://www.patreasury.gov/transparency/e-library/), where contracts are publicized. That means taxpayers (including at least two state lawmakers) had no idea about the six-figure blunder.\n\nIt’s not clear why the contract never made it online, and agencies do not have to tell the treasurer's office when or why they decide not to post one.\n\nAfter Spotlight PA's story, Rep. Seth Grove (R., York) [urged his fellow legislators](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/02/pennsylvania-contracts-transparency-portal/) to force state agencies to follow the disclosure law. He's asking the Senate to add the requirement into his bill codifying an updated version of the treasurer’s transparency portal. The measure unanimously passed the House and is awaiting consideration before the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nIn January, State Treasurer Joe Torsella began sending agencies twice-a-year reminders to upload their contracts to the portal, but scofflaws remain unchecked. And tracking how the government spends tax dollars remains difficult.\n",

Previously, they could sue in any county where the provider operated, allowing them to choose the venue where a jury might be most sympathetic.\n\nNow, more than 15 years later, a new <a href=\"http://lbfc.legis.state.pa.us/Resources/Documents/Reports/656.pdf\" target=_blank>independent study</a> casts doubt on the underlying reason for the change, concluding that the number of doctors practicing in Pennsylvania does not appear to be closely tied to the cost of malpractice insurance.\n\nThe long-awaited report, released earlier this month by the bipartisan Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, was supposed to take politics out of a contentious debate that has pitted some of the state’s most powerful special-interest groups against each other.\n\nInstead, the report was unable to answer many of the questions it was intended to address, only fueling the ongoing information war between the state’s health-care industry, which wants the rule kept intact, and trial lawyers, who want to see it scrapped.\n\nAs the Supreme Court weighs whether to make a change, each side is now claiming victory.\n\nOn the one hand, the health-care industry has revived its claims that a crisis would ensue if the rule were to be undone.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\n“I think it provides real pause and reasonable doubt for anyone who proposes to change this rule,” said Warren Kampf, a senior vice president at the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania.\n\nOn the other hand, trial lawyers said the report does not support those dire predictions. And, they argue, the current rule has harmed patients because juries in some counties, especially in rural areas, are seen as far less friendly to malpractice claims than others.\n\n“This rule was unnecessarily created to benefit and privilege one special class of defendant,” said Jason Matzus, a malpractice attorney in Pittsburgh who set off the latest round of debate when he asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the rule in late 2017.\n\nThe court, where Democrats have a majority, will have the final say on whether to keep or amend the rule, but it had agreed to postpone its decision until the report was published. Republicans who control the legislature mostly oppose any change, potentially setting up a showdown between the two branches of government.\n\nOutgoing House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) <a href=\"https://kywnewsradio.radio.com/articles/news/pa-lawmakers-warn-state-supreme-court-court-possible-malpractice-insurance-crisis\" target=_blank>warned</a> last year that a move to reverse the rule would be “an invitation to a constitutional fight between powers.”\n\nThe dispute dates to the early 2000s, when several major malpractice insurers stopped offering policies in Pennsylvania and premiums for some medical specialties spiked, prompting claims that doctors were being driven from the state.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre) said last year he remembered “standing on the steps of the Capitol, watching a lot of those white coat doctors walking by and saying, ‘We just cannot practice here in Pennsylvania anymore’ and dropping their coats in a symbolic exit.”\n\nLawmakers intervened first, passing a bill requiring the change. But an appeals court ruled the law was an unconstitutional infringement on the authority of the judicial branch. The Supreme Court then made the change by altering the rules of civil procedure.\n\nIn response to the latest request to change the rule, the hospital industry and the state medical association have revived warnings about an exodus of doctors, but the report challenged the basis of that claim.\n\n“We would not expect to see a significant decline in the number of Pennsylvania physicians practicing medicine in the commonwealth if the venue rule changes again,” Christopher Latta, the committee’s deputy executive director, <a href=\"http://lbfc.legis.state.pa.us/Resources/Documents/Presentations/658.pdf\" target=_blank>told members</a> when the study was released.\n\nIn fact, the report found, the overall number of active medical staff practicing statewide increased before and after the changes of the early 2000s. But the report left open the possibility that reversing the rule could affect access to health care more broadly, saying that with so many variables and a lack of data, it was impossible to know what would happen.\n\nAnd although the 2003 rule is often credited with lowering insurance costs, which supporters cite as evidence that it worked, the study found the decrease was probably due to wider national trends, instead.\n\nThe committee was not asked to recommend whether the rule should be changed.\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is a perception that juries in Philadelphia are more likely to side with alleged victims than in conservative, rural counties. Trial lawyers argue that the 2003 rule keeps victims from being fairly compensated and gives hospitals and doctors an unfair advantage in litigation.\n\nBecause of a lack of data, however, it’s impossible to know how overall outcomes differ from county to county. Most victims of malpractice do not file lawsuits and most cases settle out of court.\n\nWithout conclusive findings from the report, the debate is sure to continue. Sen. Lisa Baker (R., Luzerne), who introduced the resolution calling for the report and chairs the Judiciary Committee, said she plans to hold a public hearing in the spring.\n\nThat would likely be a chance for each side to rehash familiar arguments.\n\n“We’re in somewhat uncharted waters,” said Matzus, the malpractice attorney. “It will be interesting to see what the Supreme Court does.”\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=Do%20you%20have%20a%20tip%20about%20%3Cb%3Ewaste%2C%20fraud%2C%20or%20abuse%3C%2Fb%3E%20we%20should%20investigate%3F%20Tell%20us%20below.\"></div>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

At least seven of the Republican-held seats were won by Gov. Tom Wolf in 2018, making them prime targets for Democrats.\n\nAmong those retiring this year are two of the most powerful GOP lawmakers, Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson) and House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny). Both are leaders not only in the Capitol, but on the campaign trail, raising large sums of money for the party.\n\nDemocrats are hopeful the departures are a sign of good things to come in November, especially since it is a presidential election year.\n\n“In the House, for the first time in a long time, [Republicans] are going to be fighting to stay in the majority,” said Larry Ceisler, a public affairs executive and Democratic consultant. “It is still leaning Republican, but they are running in an election year where there is a lot of competition. Turzai and Scarnati are big fundraisers, and someone is going to have to pick up the slack.”\n\nTo take control of the state House, Democrats need to pick up nine seats in November. In the state Senate, the party needs to flip four districts and hold onto a purple seat President Donald Trump won in 2016.\n\nScarnati can retire knowing his district, where nearly 60% of voters are registered with the GOP, will all-but-certainly be won by another Republican. But Democrats are closely watching Turzai’s suburban Allegheny County district.\n\n“Upscale suburbs that have been in Republican hands for a long time have been swinging pretty heavily Democratic since 2016,” said Lara Putnam, a University of Pittsburgh professor who has studied anti-Trump organizing and is active in grassroots politics.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nPutnam said that Trump’s election triggered the creation of local groups focused on winning state legislative and congressional seats.\n\n“What has happened since 2016 is that this surge in citizen activism has really excited places where there are vocally active Democrats who feel strongly about contesting those seats even if it doesn’t look like an easy bet,” she said.\n\nTurzai’s last Democratic challenger, former screenwriter Emily Skopov, was new to politics when she ran in 2018. She lost by nine points but plans to run for the seat again this year.\n\nFundraising might be an issue for Republicans in the short-term, said GOP strategist Charlie Gerow.\n\nBut even with the loss of Turzai and Scarnati, Gerow said it’s a stretch to think Democrats will pick up enough seats to take the majority in either chamber.\n\nThe fact that Sen. John Yudichak changed his affiliation from Democrat to independent “made the climb for Democrats in the caucus much more steep,” Gerow said. “I don’t think there was ever a realistic prospect of Democrats taking control of the House.”\n\n## What’s behind the retirements?\n\nSome of the nearly 20 lawmakers who are not seeking reelection have cited health issues and a desire to spend more time with their families as reasons for retiring. Most have served for at least a decade, meaning they are eligible to receive hefty pensions.\n\nBut growing bipartisan gridlock, infighting, and unwillingness to compromise has also chilled morale in Harrisburg, longtime Capitol watchers say.\n\nWhen he announced his surprise resignation last year, then-Sen. Richard Alloway (R., Franklin) <a href=\"https://lancasteronline.com/news/local/lawmaker-i-m-quitting-because-i-m-sick-and-tired/article_1a4f780c-1da5-11e9-8049-734350def1b5.html\">told</a> The Caucus he was “sick and tired” of Harrisburg politics.\n\nBill Patton, a longtime aide to House Democrats, echoed the sentiment and said some lawmakers are growing weary.\n\n“It has always been difficult to pass legislation. The system is designed that way — there are many steps,” Patton said. “I think there is fatigue for a lot of members with the constant arguing and fighting.”\n\nFormer Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, a Republican who resigned after winning a seat on the Board of Bucks County Commissioners, said for most of his career lawmakers from both parties worked together to pass measures.\n\n“I’ve always been a big proponent for compromise. It is not a bad word,” said DiGirolamo, who served in the House for 25 years. “[W]hen everyone was willing to come together, we were able to pass bills.”\n\nBut Pennsylvania lawmakers today are introducing and passing fewer bills than in past decades, a Spotlight PA analysis <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/09/pa-state-legislators-among-the-highest-paid-in-us-but-theyre-doing-less-and-less-actual-lawmaking/\">showed</a>.\n\nDiGirolamo said that in his last five years as representative, he became dismayed at how few bills the legislature was able to pass.\n\n\"Forget the $15 minimum wage,” DiGirolamo said of one priority for southeast lawmakers. \"We could not ... get a vote.”\n\nRep. Tony DeLuca (D., Allegheny), who at 82 is one of the longest serving lawmakers in the General Assembly, is skeptical that frustration over stalled bills is completely responsible for retirements.\n\n\"They get their 10 years in, they make connections. Since they are guaranteed pensions, they go out and get a job after. It’s like a pay raise,” he said. “Certainly, they are getting things done in the legislature, but I don’t see too many of them retiring before they put in their 10 years. After that, they run like chickens.”\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

[Sign up for our free weekly newsletter.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/)*\n\nHARRISBURG — The Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, becoming the first diocese in the state to seek protection from financial claims in the aftermath of [a 2018 grand jury report that revealed decades of sexual abuse and cover-up](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/catholic-church-sex-abuse-clergy-pennsylvania-grand-jury-report-released-names-20180814.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/catholic-church-sex-abuse-clergy-pennsylvania-grand-jury-report-released-names-20180814.html\") by the church’s top leaders.\n\nAnd, said a lawyer for the diocese, it’s not likely to be the last.\n\nCiting the fallout from that probe and recent court decisions that opened new avenues for some victims with time-barred claims to sue, attorney Matt Haverstick said Harrisburg, like each of the state’s eight other Catholic dioceses, faces the prospect of crushing court judgments that it will be unable to pay.\n\n“There is no capacity to take that kind of exposure,” Haverstick said in an interview with The Inquirer and Spotlight PA. “I think this is really the beginning — not just in Pennsylvania but across the country — of a wave of reorganizations spawned by … the economics of trying to maintain an organization in the face of catastrophic litigation.”\n\nWith its filing Wednesday, the Harrisburg diocese joins more than two dozen others across the U.S. that have sought similar bankruptcy protections since the clergy sex abuse scandal first exploded in Boston 18 years ago.\n\nThe move comes six months after Bishop Ronald W. Gainer announced that the Harrisburg church had paid out $12.5 million in settlements with more than 100 accusers through an [independently run victim compensation fund](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/catholic-archdiocese-philadelphia-priest-sexual-abuse-compensation-fund-20181108.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/catholic-archdiocese-philadelphia-priest-sexual-abuse-compensation-fund-20181108.html\").\n\nThe diocese currently faces five pending lawsuits both in Pennsylvania and New Jersey from accusers who chose not to pursue offers through the program. But with another 200 victims known to church officials, the threat of future claims is endangering the diocese’s future, Gainer said.\n\nAt an afternoon news conference, the bishop said he believed restructuring is the best path to ensure all creditors — sex-abuse survivors included — are “equitably” compensated. It will also allow the diocese to continue offering free counseling and other support services to clergy abuse victims.\n\n“On behalf of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg, and in my own name, I continue to offer my heartfelt apologies for the abuse you suffered,\" he said, addressing victims. \"I also offer my apology and deepest regret that the diocese did not do more to protect you.”\n\n“Our current financial situation is unsustainable,” the bishop said at an afternoon news conference. “We have no other path forward to ensure the future of our dioceses.”\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nThe Harrisburg diocese serves roughly 245,000 Central Pennsylvania Catholics, covers an area of 7,660 square miles and includes 89 parishes with 98 diocesan priests.\n\nIt told the court in its filings Wednesday that it has more than 200 creditors and estimated liabilities between $50 and $100 million. Of its top 20 creditors, 19 were plaintiffs in sex abuse cases that remained unresolved in court.\n\nIts petition for bankruptcy protection freezes all pending litigation against the diocese while the court considers its reorganization plan. Compensation for victims with outstanding claims would become part of the bankruptcy judgment.\n\nBut now that that process has begun, lawyers for accusers questioned just how much of the diocese’s assets would be available to victims.\n\nWednesday’s filings revealed a complex financial structure in which much of what the diocese once owned was moved in 2009 into charitable trusts, which it maintains are beyond the reach of court judgments and bankruptcy creditors.\n\nAll of its property and non-real estate assets are owned by separate trusts, as are the parishes, who each have trusts of their own, according to the documents. A priest pension fund — from which the diocese borrowed money to fund its victim compensation fund last year — is also off limits, lawyers for the diocese said.\n\nThat type of structuring has drawn scrutiny from judges who have handled other diocesan bankruptcies.\n\n“It is common and typical in all church bankruptcies that assets will have been transferred, will have been put into different names, that there will have been trust devices or other devices to get the assets out of the pot that will be distributed to survivors,” said Thomas S. Neuberger, a Wilmington attorney who led efforts to win a $110 million settlement when that city’s diocese filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009.\n\nThe job of the attorneys for unsecured creditors — the abuse victims in this case — is to “search through all the different permutations of how assets are held” and push to include them in the creditor compensation fund, Neuberger said.\n\nThe Harrisburg diocese reported $183 million in total assets, including $144 million in investments, according its June 2018 audited financial statements. Those numbers included some, but not all, of the assets connected to the charitable trusts referenced in Wednesday’s bankruptcy filing.\n\nDiocesan lawyers say the affiliated charitable trusts were established to ensure the church could continue to serve its core functions of ministry, Catholic education and charitable service. It is just one tactic dioceses nationwide have employed to ensure their survival as the clergy sex abuse crisis endures.\n\nThe 2018 Pennsylvania grand jury investigation, led by Attorney General Josh Shapiro, set off a wave of similar probes in other states and renewed calls in state houses across the country to grant victims of decades-old childhood abuse a second-chance to sue.\n\nEight states, including New Jersey, New York and California, passed so-called “window laws” opening a short-term opportunity for victims, whose abuse had fallen outside civil statutes of limitations, to pursue lawsuits in court once more.\n\nPennsylvania’s proposed version of a “window law” ignited a contentious battle in Harrisburg, drawing opposition from Senate Republicans who warned it would violate the state constitution. Still, in November, lawmakers reached a compromise, [opting to leave the decision up to voters](https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-child-sexual-abuse-bill-statute-of-limitations-legislature-20191121.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-child-sexual-abuse-bill-statute-of-limitations-legislature-20191121.html\") in a statewide referendum.\n\nFearing the financial fallout, seven of the state’s eight Catholic dioceses launched independently managed compensation funds last year, hoping to settle some old abuse claims before any new law had the chance to pass.\n\nSeparate from the $12.5 million paid out by the Harrisburg diocese, another five funds have [paid out more than $80 million](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-catholic-church-sexual-abuse-payments-20191226.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/pennsylvania-catholic-church-sexual-abuse-payments-20191226.html\") to more than 470 individuals, said Camille Biros, who along with Kenneth R. Feinberg, administered many of the funds. (Philadelphia has not finished paying out all its compensation fund claims, but it has already [cut checks totaling nearly $39 million](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/clergy-abuse-pa-reparations-program-archdiocese-of-philadelphia-maria-panaritis-20200206.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/opinion/clergy-abuse-pa-reparations-program-archdiocese-of-philadelphia-maria-panaritis-20200206.html\") to more than 180 victims of abuse.)\n\nAccusers and their lawyers have viewed those programs with skepticism, saying that while the funds’ payouts are better than nothing, they have allowed dioceses to limit the penalties they might have faced in court.\n\nSome victims opted to take their chances, hoping that the “window law” referendum would pass or deciding to press their claims in other venues. The same day New Jersey opened its “window period” last year, [five sisters](https://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/catholic-church-sex-abuse-how-one-pennsylvania-priest-terrorized-five-sisters-20180920.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/catholic-church-sex-abuse-how-one-pennsylvania-priest-terrorized-five-sisters-20180920.html\") who say they were all [abused by the same Dauphin County priest](https://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/catholic-church-sex-abuse-how-one-pennsylvania-priest-terrorized-five-sisters-20180920.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/catholic-church-sex-abuse-how-one-pennsylvania-priest-terrorized-five-sisters-20180920.html\")i n the 1980s sued the Harrisburg diocese in that state.\n\nWith the bankruptcy filing Wednesday, [that case](https://www.inquirer.com/news/new-jersey-sex-abuse-lawsuits-dioceses-camden-philadelphia-mccarrick-fortney-boy-scouts-20191203.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/new-jersey-sex-abuse-lawsuits-dioceses-camden-philadelphia-mccarrick-fortney-boy-scouts-20191203.html\") is now in limbo.\n\n“It’s disappointing,” their lawyer Ben Andreozzi said. “We’ve been patient with them and have acted in good faith … This filing would seemingly preclude them to having to move forward in our case.”\n\nDespite the setback, lawyer Richard Serbin, who represents five Harrisburg-area sex abuse plaintiffs, said he wasn’t “ready to throw in the towel just yet.”\n\n“Survivors will now just be treated just like any other creditor,” he said. “It doesn’t mean that survivors and their claims are dead in the water and that they get nothing.”\n\n*Inquirer staff writer Harold Brubaker contributed to this article.*\n\n*[Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) receives[ funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you](https://www.spotlightpa.org/support) who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

Tom Wolf’s <a href=\"https://pennsylvaniacounts2020.info/Complete-Count-Committees/PA-Statewide-CCC\">Complete Count Commission</a>. “We also recognize that our state is more diverse than ever before, so we have to concentrate our efforts on the hard-to-count populations.”\n\nThe census takes place every 10 years to count each person in the country. The information is used to determine each state’s share of billions of dollars in federal funding and number of U.S. House seats.\n\nFor the first time, the U.S. Census Bureau is asking most people to fill out the survey online. Every household will be invited to participate by April 1.\n\nThe commission — a coalition of advocacy, education, housing, and religious organizations <a href=\"https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/pennsylvania-announces-composition-of-census-2020-complete-count-commission/\">created</a> by Wolf in September 2018 — originally requested $13 million from the legislature for outreach efforts, a dollar for each Pennsylvanian. But lawmakers were hesitant to make an investment of that size, Bristol Colón said.\n\n“Finally, they recognized the important work that needs to be done, especially when it comes to the $27 billion in federal funds we get through the census \\[each year],” he said. “They came back to the table and they provided us the opportunity to have the $4 million to do the complete count.”\n\nThe funding was included in a <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pa-election-reform-deal-20191023.html\" target=_blank>voting reform package</a> passed in 2019. Neighboring New York is <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/redistricting/2020-census-resources-and-legislation.aspx\" target=_blank>putting</a> $20 million in state funding toward the census, while New Jersey and Maryland have appropriated $9 million and $5 million, respectively.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nThe state has a $2.5 million contract with Red House Communications to produce and place census ads through radio and television stations, and in traditional print media, according to a Department of Community &amp; Economic Development spokesperson. The state has also targeted Latinx and black news outlets, Bristol Colón said, as well as social media platforms.\n\nThe department is also reviewing applications for the $1 million <a href=\"https://dced.pa.gov/programs/census-2020-outreach-grant-program/\">Census 2020 Outreach Grant Program</a>, which will award nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and higher education institutions with up to $50,000 in funding. The money will be used to target hard-to-reach groups through outreach efforts, including buying local media ads or sponsoring census-related events.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://dced.pa.gov/programs/census-2020-outreach-grant-program/\">application process</a> closes Feb. 14. The other $500,000 in state census money “is allotted for miscellaneous expenses, including printed materials for communications purposes,” a department spokesperson said.\n\nHard-to-reach populations — a blanket term for groups like minorities, immigrants, low-income earners, renters, farmworkers, and rural residents — are a priority for the state’s Complete Count Commission. Some immigrants can be <a href=\"https://pennsylvaniacounts2020.info/Portals/84/docs/Presentations/Summit/CASA_2020.pdf\" target=_blank>hard to reach </a>because of language barriers, mistrust in the U.S. government, and fear of repercussions, according to commission member and immigrants-rights group CASA.\n\nPennsylvania is home to a growing Latinx population, including Puerto Ricans who sought refuge in the state after Hurricane Maria in 2017. More than 10,000 people arrived in Pennsylvania after the devastating storm, according to CASA.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had sought to add a question about citizenship to the census, leading to concerns about an undercount of immigrant households, but <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/nation/trump-barr-census-citizenship-question-executive-action-20190711.html\">ultimately did not prevail</a>. Second Lady Gisele Fetterman, who was <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/20160412_Meet_the_other_Fetterman_who_should_probably_also_run_for_public_office.html\" target=_blank>born</a> in Brazil, is <a href=\"https://dced.pa.gov/newsroom/second-lady-fetterman-announces-2020-census-tour-dates/\" target=_blank>touring</a> select counties to promote participation.\n\nAlthough the survey is being offered online, <a href=\"https://pennsylvaniacounts2020.info/Complete-Count-Committees\">Complete Count Committees</a> — locally focused groups formed by municipalities or community leaders — are still depending on census workers to canvas areas. But finding workers to count these critical populations has been difficult.\n\nFebruary <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/us.census.bureau#!/vizhome/RecruitingGoalsCensus2020/PercentofPeakOpsRecruitingGoal\">data</a> from the Census Bureau shows successful recruitment efforts in Pennsylvania’s largest counties, including Allegheny and Philadelphia. But several rural counties in the state are under 40 percent of the hiring goal.\n\n“It has been a great challenge for the Census Bureau to fill all the temporary jobs for census 2020 due to a low unemployment rate and the digital component to the application process,” Bristol Colón said.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

But an independent office tasked with reviewing them is questioning whether some are really paying dividends for taxpayers.\n\nProponents say tax credit programs are needed to spur investment or tackle problems that, without financial help, might never get addressed. Critics argue the programs usually benefit special interests and lack accountability.\n\n“There simply hasn't been enough scrutiny and analysis on whether tax credits actually work,” said Sen. Vincent Hughes (D., Philadelphia), who wrote the 2017 amendment that charged the fiscal office with reviewing all the state’s tax credits once every five years.\n\n“Tax credits are often pitched as incentives to stimulate growth … through investments from businesses, but there hasn't always been a follow-up,” Hughes said.\n\n<i><b>» ACT NOW to support accountability journalism that keeps track of your tax dollars in Harrisburg. </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate\"><i><b>Donate to Spotlight PA and help power more stories like this one</b></i></a><i><b>.</b></i>\n\nTake the broadband tax credit, which was created in 2013 after being tucked into a wide-ranging budget bill. It’s unclear who added it or exactly why, but the Independent Fiscal Office, which recently reviewed a number of tax credit programs, concluded it was meant to expand mobile internet access in rural areas.\n\n“These code bills are kind of done at the last minute, and a lot of things are stuffed in there,” said Nathan Benefield, vice president of the Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank. “There isn’t a lot of transparency on them.”\n\nExtending broadband to sparsely populated rural areas often doesn’t make financial sense for internet companies, leaving many places with spotty connections. Twenty-four states offer financial incentives for investments in broadband — mostly in the form of cash grants rather than tax credits — and almost all prioritize areas that have limited access, or none, the review found.\n\nPennsylvania’s program, on the other hand, does not specifically require that companies claiming the credit invest in those areas. As a result, companies have received more than $12 million in tax credits over the past five years for investments in places that probably already had broadband access, creating little public benefit, the fiscal office concluded.\n\n“The greatest bang for the buck is when the investment is going to an underserved area,” Matthew Knittel, director of the fiscal office, told a state board in late January.\n\nThe fiscal office estimated that 90 percent of the spending would have happened even if the tax credit had not been available.\n\nThe credit only applies to mobile broadband equipment, limiting the pool of eligible companies. Since 2015, only three — including Philadelphia-based Comcast — have taken advantage of the credit.\n\nA Comcast spokesperson declined to comment. State law prohibits the Department of Revenue from naming the two other companies that have claimed the credit, or saying how much they received, an agency spokesperson said.\n\n<i><b>» SAVE TIME and sign up for </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA’s free weekly newsletter</b></i></a><i><b> to receive the most important news from the Capitol and a roundup of can’t-miss stories from across Pa.</b></i>\n\nThe fiscal office recommended converting the broadband tax credit to a competitive grant program targeting underserved areas. Two Republican lawmakers have already said they will introduce legislation to do so.\n\nIn its current form, the tax credit is “just a subsidy,” said Rep. George Dunbar (R., Westmoreland), who plans to co-sponsor the bill.\n\n“The idea behind the tax credit was to hopefully improve rural broadband access and, in the report, it specifically says it’s not accomplishing that goal,” he said.\n\nAnother program reviewed by the fiscal office, the Keystone Innovation Zone tax credit, was created to benefit start-up companies operating near universities throughout the state, encouraging entrepreneurship. A lack of reliable data, however, makes quantifying its economic impact “very difficult,” the fiscal office found.\n\nThe state Department of Community &amp; Economic Development says the program has helped create more than 11,000 jobs since its creation, keeping more than 3,500 college graduates in the state.\n\nBut those numbers are reported by companies receiving the tax credits and aren’t checked by the department, the fiscal office noted. The state also doesn’t track how much the jobs pay, if the companies receive other tax credits or grants, or how graduates fare after leaving the program.\n\n“We do think there’s great potential with this credit, but there’s a critical need for more data and better data,” Knittel, the fiscal office director, said at the hearing.\n\nWhat’s more, the tax credit was one of two recently implicated in a major scam.\n\nBecause most start-up companies don’t turn a profit, they don’t owe enough in taxes to benefit from the credit. As a result, between 80 to 90 percent of the credits awarded each year are sold, with tax credit brokers taking roughly five cents of every dollar as commission, the report found. A separate tax credit for research and development spending can also be sold.\n\nAccording to the state attorney general, those two programs were at the heart of a scheme run by a Bucks County couple, who received $6.4 million by selling tax credits awarded to their network of shell companies. They mostly ran the scam from Hong Kong, where they remain.\n\nThe fiscal office recommended ending the ability to sell tax credits from both programs and making them refundable, meaning firms that don’t owe enough in taxes to benefit would receive a cash grant instead.\n\nAnother report addressed a tax credit deemed to have a worthy goal: encouraging organ donation by reducing the financial burdens for donors, like travel expenses and time off work. But none of the companies or advocacy groups contacted by the fiscal office were aware that the credit even existed.\n\n“I’m not opposed to tax credits, but there has to be a benefit,” said Dunbar, who sits on the board that oversees the fiscal office. Its reviews, he said, have been “enlightening.”\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=Do%20you%20have%20a%20tip%20about%20%3Cb%3Ewaste%2C%20fraud%20or%20abuse%3C%2Fb%3E%20that%20we%20should%20investigate%3F%20Tell%20us%20now.\"></div>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

[Sign up for our free weekly newsletter](https://www.spotlightpa.org/ \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/\").*\n\nHARRISBURG — The top Republican in the Pennsylvania Senate announced late Wednesday that he is not running for reelection, becoming the second ranking GOP lawmaker in the Capitol to seek retirement in a pivotal election year.\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson) said in a statement that his decision was “personal, not political,” and that he looked forward to spending more time with his family after nearly 20 years in the legislature.\n\n“I have worked with five governors and throughout this time I am proud to have been a leading advocate for rural Pennsylvania values,” Scarnati said in a statement.\n\nHe declined to comment further when reached by phone Wednesday evening.\n\nThough he largely worked behind the scenes, Scarnati has for the better part of a decade helped set the policy agenda in the Capitol. Unlike some Republican leaders in Harrisburg, he was widely viewed as able to compromise with Democrats at a time of increasing partisanship.\n\nHis willingness to work with Democrats at times became a double-edged sword, with more conservative Republicans complaining that he conceded core GOP ideology for the sake of cutting deals.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nEarly in his tenure in leadership, Scarnati also came under scrutiny for accepting [a free trip to the Super Bowl](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/special_packages/inquirer/marcellus-shale/20110213_Perks_from_Pa__drilling_interests.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/special_packages/inquirer/marcellus-shale/20110213_Perks_from_Pa\\_\\_drilling_interests.html\") from a natural gas driller (he later said he intended to repay the company).\n\nAnd last year, a [series by Spotlight PA and The Caucus](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/10/lavish-dinners-sports-tickets-and-nearly-3.5-million-other-expenses-by-pa.-lawmakers-youve-never-seen/ \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/10/lavish-dinners-sports-tickets-and-nearly-3.5-million-other-expenses-by-pa.-lawmakers-youve-never-seen/\") revealed that Scarnati topped the list of lawmakers who shielded lavish campaign spending — including overseas trips and expensive meals — by not reporting the details to the public.\n\nScarnati is the second top Republican in as many months to announce his retirement. Earlier this year, House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) said [he would not run](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/01/mike-turzai-pennsylvania-house-speaker-retiring/ \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/01/mike-turzai-pennsylvania-house-speaker-retiring/\") for another two-year term.\n\nThe retirements are expected to be a blow to GOP fundraising efforts in a critical election year. Outside the policy arena, Scarnati, like Turzai, had been a prolific fundraiser for Republican legislative candidates across the state. It is a role he was widely expected to step into again this year, as Democrats in both chambers seek to take the majority from Republicans.\n\nScarnati’s announcement came just days before the state’s deadline to file petitions to get on the ballot. Several candidates are expected to vie for his seat.\n\nJohn “Herm” Suplizio, the city manager of DuBois, was introduced earlier this week at the Elk County Republican Party meeting as Scarnati’s replacement candidate.\n\nGrace Jesberger, a longtime member of the Elk County Republican Party, said in an interview Wednesday night that state Rep. Cris Dush (R., Jefferson) was at the meeting and spoke to members about his interest in running for the seat. He left nomination papers behind, she said.\n\nReached for comment Wednesday, Dush said: “I am running.”\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

The office later learned its investigators were barred from carrying firearms, and the purchases have been sitting in storage since. (A spokesperson for the office said it is working to “return or repurpose the firearms.”​)\n\nIt is not clear why the gun purchases were not disclosed.\n\nThe state treasurer’s office has no record of the contract, meaning it did not appear on the online portal. The office also has no authority to compel agencies to upload contracts, meaning the tool provides an incomplete look at state government spending. The issue was the focus of a 2019 <a href=\"https://lancasteronline.com/the-state-treasury-s-transparency-portal-doesn-t-work-no/article_c7271446-4382-11ea-9212-5bad1f66b869.html\">investigation</a> by The Caucus.\n\nIn response to the Spotlight PA article, Rep. Seth Grove (R., York) is calling on the General Assembly to  make state agencies follow the disclosure law.\n\n“It frustrates me a little bit to find this stuff out in the newspaper,” Grove told Spotlight PA, adding that “at some point, the General Assembly needs to do a better job of digging into contracts.”\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nCurrent reporting requirements amount to an “honor system” with “no real teeth,” he said. To remedy that, he would like to see the legislature compel state government entities to report spending for publication on the portal, potentially by withholding funding for agencies that don’t comply.\n\n“This sort of information shouldn’t be tucked away. Rather, it should be readily and easily available to the public,” he <a href=\"http://www.repgrove.com/News/16547/Press-Releases/They-Spent-$160,000-of-Your-Money-on-What?\">wrote</a> on his legislative website.\n\nGrove is asking the Senate to add the requirement into his bill codifying an updated version of the treasurer’s transparency portal. The measure passed the House 200-0 last June and is awaiting consideration in the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThat committee’s chair, state Sen. Pat Browne (R., Lehigh), did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre) said ​the proposal has not yet been discussed but \"as always, we will consider any House bill when it reaches the Senate.\"\n\nIn January, State Treasurer Joe Torsella sent a letter to all commonwealth agencies reminding them of their obligation to submit required contract details. Those reminders will now go out twice a year, he said.\n\nAshley Matthews, a spokesperson for the treasurer's office, said Torsella \"strongly supports efforts to increase transparency and efficiency in state government and he commends Rep. Grove for his continued commitment to transparency.\"\n\n“Pennsylvanians deserve to know exactly how their tax dollars are spent,” she said.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

But he’s best known for his outspoken criticism of Sunoco’s Mariner East pipelines, which run through his county.\n\nIn the legislature, Dinniman has introduced bills to reform pipeline safety regulations. He also brought a formal complaint and emergency petition before the state Public Utility Commission, which halted <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/energy/puc-halts-sunoco-mariner-east-me2-pipeline-dinniman-20180524.html\" target=\"_blank\">operation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/energy/puc-allows-mariner-east-me1-pipeline-to-restart-west-whiteland-20180614.html\" target=\"_blank\">construction</a> of Mariner pipelines in 2018.

I know how important this access can be.\n\nBefore I started at Spotlight PA, I was looking into a shady company. I’d heard some alarming anecdotes and wanted to dig deeper, so I fired off a few records requests. It took one week for reports to arrive in my inbox with information that was a boon to my reporting.\n\nThen I moved to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe first records request I filed here, for consumer complaints, was promptly dismissed. They largely aren’t obtainable in the state.\n\nEven when the law is on my side, barriers to access pop up frequently. Access to government records here is so dire, in fact, that the [Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press](https://www.rcfp.org/local/) recently announced it’s [sending a dedicated lawyer to fight for access](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/01/local-legal-initiative/) on behalf of Pennsylvania journalists.\n\nSo, yes, last week’s poll result was welcome news. Of 628 registered voters, 79% agreed that “citizens should have the right to obtain any government record with few restrictions.”\n\nBut as a journalist, I parse details, and when I read the other phrase that respondents were handed, I didn’t know what to make of the results. Of those polled, 19% selected the second option: “Citizens should have the right to obtain government records only in limited circumstances.”\n\nWhat do “few restrictions” and “limited circumstances” actually mean? Should the public be able to obtain “any” government record? What about privacy concerns and security risks?\n\nTurns out, I’m not the only one asking.\n\n“The question is, what are the limits?” said Erik Arneson, executive director of Pennsylvania’s Office of Open Records. “The question is, what’s reasonable?”\n\nThese questions don’t have clear answers, but they won’t stop me from sending more records requests.\n",

The group had also missed filing deadlines for four other reports since the beginning of 2018, state officials said.\n\nIn a statement, Micah Sims, the executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, said he accepted “full responsibility” and apologized to the group’s board chair, Brian Cullin, as well as the national organization as a whole. Sims promised the error would not happen again.\n\n“We have put in place a proactive process to address the filing issues and ensure that reports are always filed on time,” Sims said. “As a good government group advocating for increased transparency in politics and government we have a responsibility to model the benefits of transparency.”\n\n***» DONATE NOW and [show your support for Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate)’s team of journalists fighting for accountability in the state capital.***\n\nScott Swenson, a spokesperson for Common Cause’s national office based in Washington, D.C., said that Common Cause remained confident in Sims' leadership.\n\n“Micah acknowledged his mistake and agreed with the board how to improve systems, so it doesn’t happen again,” Swenson said. “People make mistakes.

In Pennsylvania, groups must report who they hired as lobbyists, the subjects they lobbied on, and the total amount of money they spent on lobbying efforts.\n\nWhen first contacted by a Spotlight PA reporter following the Ethics Commission’s fine, Sims said his group was late in filing its expense report due to technical problems with the Department of State’s website. Sims said his group intended to challenge the penalty in court.\n\nBut the Department of State disputed Sims account and said it had no record of any communications from Common Cause Pennsylvania or any indication of a technical problem. On Friday, Common Cause affirmed it would not fight the fine in court.\n\n“Common Cause will not challenge the fines in court and apologizes to the Ethics Commission for statements that suggested otherwise,” the statement said. “We intend to work with the commission to honor our responsibility and restore our reputation with that office.”\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=Know%20something%20about%20Pennsylvania%20lobbyists%20that%20we%20%3Ci%3Eneed%3C%2Fi%3E%20to%20know%20about%3F%20%3Cb%3ETell%20us%20below.%3C%2Fb%3E\"></div>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

[Sign up for our weekly newsletter.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters)*\n\nHARRISBURG — The Pennsylvania bureau tasked with discovering puppy mills and handling dangerous dogs expects to run out of money by this summer, in part because license fees for the state's canines are stuck at pre-2000 levels.\n\nIn a [report](https://www.paauditor.gov/press-releases/auditor-general-depasquale-fights-for-adequate-funding-to-continue-dog-law-enforcement-efforts) released Thursday, state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said the Bureau of Dog Law Enforcement’s financial situation means it may no longer be able to “make sure dogs and puppies offered for sale or held in boarding facilities are kept in safe, humane conditions.”\n\n“We have made tremendous strides since 2007 when we were the puppy mill capital of the nation,” DePasquale said at a news conference Thursday in the Capitol. “We are not in the same state today, but we can and will do better.”\n\nThe bureau, which operates under the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, inspects the state’s 2,600 dog kennels at least twice a year, an onerous task that is now divided among 41 wardens. It’s funded in large part by revenue from dog license and kennel license fees.\n\nAlthough state law requires dogs more than 12 weeks old to be licensed, only slightly more than half of the dogs in Pennsylvania — 1.3 million — are, DePasquale said.\n\nWhat’s more, the license fees for dogs and kennels have not been raised in more than 20 years. Currently, it costs $6.50 to register a canine that is spayed or neutered, and $8.50 for one that is not.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nTo cut costs, the bureau has reduced the number of wardens on staff, its director, Kristen Donmoyer, said Thursday. Still, the office finds itself in a dire financial situation ,exacerbated by the diversion of funds to the judicial branch.\n\n“We have an uphill battle when it comes to adequate funding,” said Donmoyer, noting that $200,000 of the bureau’s revenue from fees is redirected to upgrade the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts’ computer systems.\n\nShe added that it’s possible there will be more cuts to personnel if the General Assembly doesn’t act soon.\n\nIn 2008, the legislature revamped the state’s dog law, focusing on commercial kennels that were largely unregulated. DePasquale audited the bureau in 2013 and found it was not adhering to inspection regulations.\n\nIn the audit released Thursday, DePasquale said that while the bureau has addressed many of the issues previously raised, funding problems have severely paralyzed the office.\n\nAnd while lawmakers have introduced bills in recent years to address the funding issues, none have passed. There are currently four pending in the General Assembly that would help the bureau fill vacancies and continue inspections.\n\nA pair of bills in the [House](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&sInd=0&body=H&type=B&bn=1504) and [Senate](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&sInd=0&body=S&type=B&bn=0663) would increase the dog licensing fee to $10 for a one-year license and $49 for a lifetime license. [Another bill](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&sInd=0&body=S&type=B&bn=0798) in the Senate would double the dangerous dog fee to $1,000 annually. And a House proposal would [end the diversion](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&sInd=0&body=H&type=B&bn=1277) of $200,000 to the courts.\n\n“That would be a significant amount,” DePasquale said.\n\n“We are hopeful that the General Assembly will increase fees and supply the funding we need to continue protecting Pennsylvania’s puppies and dogs, protecting consumers victimized by illegal kennel operators, and protecting our communities from dangerous and stray animals,” Donmoyer said.\n\n*[Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) receives [funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you](https://www.spotlightpa.org/support) who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

The group has also been late in filing four other reports since the beginning of 2018, state officials said.\n\nLobbying reports are one of the only ways the public can see how advocacy groups, special interests, and big businesses are attempting to influence lawmakers. In Pennsylvania, groups are required to disclose the names of any lobbyists they employ, the subject matter they lobbied on, and the total amount of money they spent on it.\n\nThough Common Cause Pennsylvania reports spending only a few thousand dollars each year on lobbying, the Ethics Commission nonetheless expressed its disappointment over the group’s failures, especially since it had helped champion the current law.\n\n“It’s such a shame,” Chairman Nicholas Colafella said after the Jan. 23 vote to impose the fine.\n\n<i><b>» </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate\"><i><b>DONATE NOW and show your support</b></i></a><i><b> for Spotlight PA’s team of journalists fighting for accountability in the state capital.</b></i>\n\nWhen contacted by Spotlight PA, Micah Sims, the executive director of the state chapter, said he was unaware of the fine and was surprised it had been issued. He conceded the filing was late but said it was because of technical difficulties with the Department of State’s website. He said the group had been in “constant communication” with the department about the problem.\n\nSims said he could not recall receiving any warning from the Ethics Commission and pledged that his organization would fight the penalty in court.\n\n“We will be filing a motion against the penalty because it wasn’t necessarily our error,” Sims said. “It was an error of the Department of State.”\n\nBut the Department of State and the Ethics Commission disputed Sims’ account.\n\n<i><b>» RELATED: Common Cause Pennsylvania director works <a href=\" https://billypenn.com/2020/02/06/pa-government-watchdog-is-working-questionable-side-job-with-phillys-new-sheriff/\">questionable side job</a> for Philly's new sheriff.</i></b>\n\nLaura Weis, a spokesperson for the state department, said in a statement that at no point had Common Cause Pennsylvania made it aware of any technical issues or problems filing its expense report.\n\nWeis also said the department sent two emails to the organization within a week of the missed deadline. The Ethics Commission said it sent a letter on Aug. 29 by certified mail, addressed to Sims, warning him that his organization would be fined if it didn’t file within 30 days.\n\n“I have no information and no knowledge that Common Cause tried to file,” said Rob Caruso, executive director of the commission.\n\nCommon Cause ultimately filed its report Nov. 2.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/newsletter/\"></div>\n\nOn Jan. 31, eight days after Spotlight PA first inquired about the fines, the board chair of Common Cause Pennsylvania, Brian Cullin, said the organization’s failure to file the reports on time “is completely contrary to what we stand for.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter that the amounts we report are small — we are still obligated to file, and to file on time,” Cullin said. “We failed to do that, and we are very sorry.”\n\nCullin said he was not aware of the failure until Spotlight PA’s inquiries. In the future, he said, he will personally file the reports and send them to the Common Cause national office to ensure proper oversight.\n\n“This will not happen again,” he said.\n\nCullin said Common Cause Pennsylvania is interested in negotiating a smaller fine from the Ethics Commission, but presently has no intention to fight the penalty in court.\n\nIn 2018, the legislature imposed stiffer penalties for lobbying groups that file late, and that has led to better compliance, said Caruso, of the Ethics Commission. Before the change, the commission fined about 20 groups each year. In 2019, it fined about 10 of the estimated 1,700 groups.\n\n“So overall we are seeing good compliance,” Caruso said.\n\nSims said Common Cause Pennsylvania has long complied with the state’s lobbying disclosure law and the late filing was an anomaly.\n\nBut Weis, the department spokesperson, said the group was late in filing four other quarterly expense reports since the beginning of 2018. Two occasions resulted in formal notices of non-compliance by the Ethics Commission. In each of those occasions, however, the group filed before the commission issued a penalty.\n\nSims said he didn’t know why the group had missed the deadlines. But he noted that, with an annual budget of $200,000 and two full-time staff, they spend little on lobbying. According to the Department of State’s website, Common Cause Pennsylvania spent $5,600 in 2019 on lobbying.\n\nThat’s about a quarter of the fine it now owes for filing late.\n\n<script src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embed.js\" async></script><div data-spl-embed-version=\"1\" data-spl-src=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/embeds/tips/?tip_text=Know%20something%20about%20Pennsylvania%20lobbyists%20that%20we%20%3Ci%3Eneed%3C%2Fi%3E%20to%20know%20about%3F%20%3Cb%3ETell%20us%20below.%3C%2Fb%3E\"></div>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "**\\*Capitol Notebook by [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/)** provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg. [Sign up for our weekly newsletter.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters)*\n\nHARRISBURG — Patients in Pennsylvania facing the most serious stage of cancer will no longer be forced to try cheaper drugs before their insurance covers other, more expensive treatments.\n\nThe state House on Tuesday gave final approval to a bill that would abolish the heavily criticized “fail first” approach for stage IV cancer, which requires patients to show no improvement with cheaper, insurance-approved drugs before moving on to more innovative approaches.\n\nThe bill is now before Gov. Tom Wolf, who intends to sign it, according to his office.\n\nThe measure was sponsored by Rep. Kerry Benninghoff (R., Centre), who has experienced cancer up close several times, first as a hospital orderly helping ill patients decades ago, and then again as the Centre County coroner. His late mother was diagnosed with cancer about 40 years ago.\n\nHe was confronted with the disease again in 2008 when doctors discovered his 4-year-old daughter had a brain tumor. She died after two years of surgeries and radiation.\n\n“You do your best as a parent. You teach them to look left and right, but then like a thief in the night, this happens,” Benninghoff, who chairs the [House Cancer Caucus](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/house_bio.cfm?id=215), said in an interview. “It’s still raw.”\n\nThe bill would require health insurance policies to cover drugs prescribed to patients with stage IV cancer — meaning it has spread to other organs or parts of the body — as long as they have been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for cancer treatment and are consistent with best practices.\n\n“When you sit in a hospital for two and a half years, you get a lot of opportunities to talk to patients, families, and doctors,” Benninghoff said. “Physicians go to school to practice medicine and get people well — they don’t go to deal with legislative policies or insurance companies.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nCurrently, oncologists shrink tumors and target cancerous blood cells with a cocktail of drugs, surgeries, or radiation treatments following protocols — schedules of when and how much of a medicine to administer — that are approved by a health insurance company’s reimbursement plan.\n\n“Fail first,” also known as step therapy, can postpone access to potentially life-prolonging therapies, Elizabeth Franklin, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Cancer Policy Institute at the Cancer Support Community, said in an email.\n\n“These policies can be shortsighted,” Franklin said, adding “they have the potential to cause significant harm as they may delay access to therapies that are the most appropriate and effective.”\n\nThis bill, Benninghoff said, changes the dynamic between physicians and health insurance companies.\n\n“I think it is ridiculous when the insurer is trying to dictate medical decisions,” he said. “\\[The legislation] puts the patient and the doctor in charge. At stage IV, the cancer is aggressive. We want to give the patient the best chance — not make them go through weeks of medications that don’t address that person’s concerns at the time.”\n\nA major Pennsylvania-based insurance company supports the bill, known as the Fair Access to Cancer Treatment Act, and hopes it will help rein in drug prices.\n\n“\\[W]e are concerned about the increasing cost of prescription drugs which has a direct impact on our members’ access to affordable care,” Dr. Ginny Calega, vice president of medical affairs at Independence Blue Cross, said in a statement. “We believe this bill strikes an important balance between access, quality, and safety, including assurances that coverage follows clinical best practices.”\n\n\\\nRep. Pamela DeLissio (D., Philadelphia), a cancer survivor, voted “no” on the bill when it came before the House in 2019, because it does not cover the use of off-label drugs, medicines that have not been approved by the FDA for cancer treatment.\n\n“In confounding situations, an off-label drug would be used,” DeLissio said by phone. “When it is stage IV, there are no more stages after that. If there was a possibility of a drug working, I would want to use it.”\n\nBenninghoff said he knows the scope of the bill is narrow, but sometimes compromise is the only way to move legislation forward.\n\n“I don’t want to waste another day, week, month trying to fight for perfection, when we can help a lot of people,” he said. “Sometimes you have to take half a loaf instead of a whole loaf.”\n\nLegislatures in [Georgia](http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:GA2015000H965&ciq=ncsl62&client_md=403e6f0fc8de8df58c82b96ef0a5ba94&mode=current_text), [Illinois](http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:IL2017000H4821&ciq=ncsl62&client_md=fad451564d0efd215f03893445fc7c79&mode=current_text), and [Maryland](http://custom.statenet.com/public/resources.cgi?id=ID:bill:MD2017000S919&ciq=ncsl62&client_md=362745f34980f11a41f260e2c1b8e6ef&mode=current_text) have passed similar legislation in recent years.\n\n***Correction**: A previous version of this story misattributed a statement from Independence Blue Cross.

			"body": "***Capitol Notebook by Spotlight PA** provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg. [Sign up for our weekly newsletter.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters)*\n\nA decade ago, then-Gov. Ed Rendell declared passing gun control laws in Pennsylvania “a lost cause,” saying the legislature was too beholden to gun rights groups to make any changes.\n\nOn Tuesday, another Democratic governor made an impassioned plea to state lawmakers to take up the issue by mandating universal background checks and passing a “red flag” law to allow firearms to be temporarily seized from people declared by a court a threat to themselves or others.\n\n“Let’s make 2020 the year we choose to stop being cynical about the politics of gun violence,” Gov. Tom Wolf told a joint session of the legislature while <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/spl/pennsylvania-governor-tom-wolf-budget-address-20200204.html\" >pitching his latest budget</a>.\n\nMany of Wolf’s proposals, including strengthening reporting requirements for lost and stolen firearms, mirror ones that Rendell and others called for in 2010. The state’s laws have remained largely unchanged since then.\n\nRepublicans leaders, who control both legislative chambers, on Tuesday were noncommittal about Wolf’s call for action on gun bills.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nJennifer Kocher, spokesperson for Senate Republicans, said her caucus has not yet taken a position on the specific changes Wolf pushed on Tuesday. But, she said, Republican senators are attempting to tackle the issue of gun-violence more “holistically,” including factoring in proposals surrounding mental health and school safety.\n\nIn recent years, the majority party has been more open to holding hearings to debate gun violence prevention proposals. In 2018, the legislature approved a measure further restricting gun access for people convicted of some domestic violence crimes, as well as people covered under final protection-from-abuse orders. It was hailed as a watershed moment in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn this legislative session, both chambers have continued hearings on gun-related bills — although the House’s Judiciary Committee chairman made headlines last fall when he abruptly declared that no other gun-related bills would be considered by his panel. That all but ensures that a red flag proposal that seemed to be gaining momentum will not get a vote this legislative session, which ends in November.\n\nStill, advocates for more gun restrictions on Tuesday said they believed Wolf’s plea could change the legislative playbook.\n\n“I’m glad to see that the governor has taken the bully pulpit and put it at the level that it deserves to be,” said Philadelphia City Council President Darrell L. Clarke, who was in the Capitol Tuesday with Mayor Jim Kenney and Councilmember Cherelle L. Parker to hear Wolf speak.\n\nSaid Kenney: “I have nothing against gun ownership or hunting or anything like that. It’s just people have different cultural experiences. And ours around guns in the city and the surrounding area involve death, and not hunting or sport.”\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

Tom Wolf on Tuesday proposed a $36 billion dollar budget with no major tax increases that would boost funding for public education, expand full-day kindergarten to all students, borrow money to address environmental hazards in schools, and make sweeping changes to how charter schools are funded.\n\nIn his annual address before a joint session of the General Assembly, the Democratic governor also departed from the boundaries of a traditional budget speech to make a strong plea for stricter gun laws in a state with a long history of taking a hands-off approach to the issue.\n\nWolf called for universal background checks, stronger reporting requirements for lost and stolen firearms, and a “red flag” law that would give judges the ability to temporarily seize firearms from people considered a threat to themselves or others.\n\n“The steps I’m proposing are supported by the evidence and supported by the vast majority of Pennsylvanians,” Wolf said, adding: “To let another session go by without action would be a failure of imagination that will cost lives.”\n\nThough the governor’s sixth proposed budget reflected his long held priorities of championing public education, it also recognized the reality of negotiating with [Republican lawmakers who control the state legislature](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania-legislature-democrats-2020-election-20191125.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania-legislature-democrats-2020-election-20191125.html\"), and who in years past have rejected several of the administration’s big-ticket revenue proposals.\n\nWolf’s plan, for instance, would not hike either the state’s sales or income taxes — the two largest sources of revenue — but instead would seek to raise new dollars through targeted fees on municipalities to fund, among other items, the State Police budget.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nThe governor also renewed his call to gradually raise Pennsylvania’s minimum wage to $15 an hour, another proposal that has been met with resistance by some Republican lawmakers.\n\nRepublicans who control both legislative chambers emerged from Wolf’s speech with a list of complaints about the proposal, which calls for increasing spending by almost 6% over [this fiscal year’s $34 billion spending plan](https://www.inquirer.com/news/tom-wolf-signs-budget-deal-20190628.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/tom-wolf-signs-budget-deal-20190628.html\"). (That does not include an additional $600 million the governor is seeking to cover cost overruns in this year’s budget.)\n\nGOP lawmakers took aim at Wolf’s proposed increase in spending, saying the administration wants to spend more than it can bring in. Wolf’s budget relies heavily on a projection that revenue will grow 4.5%, or $1.6 billion, in the next fiscal year. Republicans also attacked the amount of money the governor is seeking to borrow to fund some of his signature proposals.\n\n“It’s easy to put things on a credit card and then ask other people in the future to pay for it,\" said State Rep. Stan Saylor (R., York), who chairs the powerful House Appropriations Committee. \"That is not the solution for Pennsylvania.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre) called Wolf’s budget address “the red meat speech,” meant to please the governor’s constituency but ultimately unrealistic.\n\n“We will get to a fiscally responsible budget that does not ask the taxpayers to invest more in state government,” Corman said.\n\nBut this is an election year — a time when elected officials try to avoid any drawn-out conflict or controversy — and there could be pressure to wrap up the budget well before the July 1 deadline.\n\nHere are some highlights from Wolf’s budget:\n\n### Education\n\n\\-Public schools would receive an additional $100 million, and the governor is proposing an extra $25 million for special education funding.\n\n\\-Wolf would boost funding for early childhood education by $30 million: $25 million for Pre-K Counts and $5 million for the Head Start Supplemental program.\n\n\\-The governor would expand free, full-time kindergarten to every Pennsylvania student, and pay for it through [a separate reform plan](https://www.inquirer.com/news/charter-school-reform-pennsylvania-tom-wolf-budget-20200203.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/charter-school-reform-pennsylvania-tom-wolf-budget-20200203.html\") for charter schools.\n\n\\-Wolf is again proposing to raise the minimum salary for public school teachers to $45,000 per year, from $18,500 per year.\n\n\\-Under an expanded grant program, $1 billion in state funding, typically set aside for capital projects would be available to remediate lead- and asbestos-tainted schools, [an issue that has been particularly acute in Philadelphia.](https://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/toxic-city-philadelphia-inquirer-investigation-lead-asbestos-schools-20170618.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/toxic-city-philadelphia-inquirer-investigation-lead-asbestos-schools-20170618.html\")\n\n### Higher education\n\n\\-The governor wants to siphon $204 million from the state’s Race Horse Development Trust Fund to provide financial assistance to full-time students in Pennsylvania’s state colleges and universities.\n\n\\-State-run universities would receive almost $13 million to redesign technology infrastructure.\n\n\\-Funding to state-related universities including Penn State and Temple University would remain unchanged.\n\n### Charter school reform\n\nThe governor is proposing [changes to charter school laws](https://www.inquirer.com/news/charter-school-reform-pennsylvania-tom-wolf-budget-20200203.html \"https\\://www.inquirer.com/news/charter-school-reform-pennsylvania-tom-wolf-budget-20200203.html\") that he said will save school districts, which pay for charters but do not run them, about $280 million every year. Among the proposed reforms:\n\n\\-The administration would apply a tiered special education funding formula to charter schools.\n\n\\-Wolf would establish a statewide tuition rate for cyber charter schools, which currently receive between $7,700 and $21,400 per student per year. The new rate would be $9,500 per student every year.\n\n### Minimum wage\n\nWolf is asking the legislature to approve raising the state’s minimum wage from the current $7.25 per hour to $12 beginning this July. That rate would increase every year by 50 cents until it reaches $15 per hour in July2026. The Senate late last year approved a plan to gradually hike the minimum wage to $9.50 per hour, but the House has not yet taken up the proposal.\n\n### State police fee\n\nWolf is resurrecting a new version of a proposal he championed in recent years to impose a fee for State Police coverage on municipalities that don’t have their own police forces. This year, the governor is seeking a fee on all municipalities based on the level of coverage. It would factor in a town’s population and income.\n\n*[Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/ \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/\") receives[ funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you](https://www.spotlightpa.org/support \"https\\://www.spotlightpa.org/support\") who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "### **THE BUDGET COMETH**\n\n1,000,000. That’s about how many minimum wage workers would be eligible for a raise under **Gov. Tom Wolf’s** proposed 2020-21 budget, which he will officially unveil Tuesday. Wolf previewed parts of his proposal across the state last week, and on his wish list for the sixth-straight year is increasing Pennsylvania’s wage floor from $7.25 an hour to $12, and eventually up to $15. But Republicans in the legislature remain opposed.\n\n**Wolf’s budget would also:**\n\n* Fund an “[innovation plan](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-announces-pa-innovation-plan-proposal/)” that earmarks millions for workforce development\n* Create a new grant program to “[address employment barriers](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-business-and-labor-leaders-unveil-strategy-to-strengthen-pennsylvanias-workforce/)”\n* Put $1 billion (yes, billion) toward [lead and asbestos clean-ups](https://www.inquirer.com/news/gov-tom-wolf-asbestos-lead-schools-1-billion-20200129.html) in schools\n* [Invest heavily in human services programs](https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolfs-2020-21-budget-will-further-protect-vulnerable-populations/), including $1.2 million to train workers who look after people receiving long-term care outside of institutions\n\nWolf is scheduled to deliver his budget address at 11:30 a.m. in the Capitol. His speech will be streamed live at [governor.pa.gov/live](https://www.governor.pa.gov/live/). \n\n### **CONTROVERSY OVER KOBE**\n\nIn the wake of **Kobe Bryant’s** death and a “heartbroken” message from Wolf, state **Sen. Katie Muth** (D., Montgomery)[ tweeted](https://twitter.com/SenatorMuth/status/1221989050673922050) that the NBA legend’s “talent does not override or neutralize the fact that he was charged with rape.” That set off a firestorm in the progressive lawmaker’s mentions, but the conflict wasn’t contained to the internet. Muth also objected to a condolence resolution offered by state **Sen. Daylin Leach** (D., Montgomery).\n\n“I had several calls from survivors,” Muth told Spotlight PA. “We are still having difficulty talking about sexual violence.”\n\nShe added that there were objections to the resolution’s proponent, Leach, who has been accused of sexual assault. Leach vehemently denies the decades-old accusation, and he is suing his accuser, two of her supporters, the Inquirer, and a Spotlight PA reporter.\n\nAn aide to Leach told PennLive the resolution’s fate is “[up in the air](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/01/pa-legislator-sparks-outrage-after-tweeting-about-kobe-bryants-sexual-assault-allegation.html).”\n\nMuth is a survivor of sexual assault and has introduced #MeToo-inspired legislation. One bill would ban the use of non-disclosure agreements when lawmakers are credibly accused of sexual harassment and would regulate professional behavior in the legislature.\n\n### **A VETO — AND A LAWSUIT**\n\nThe state Senate voted 28-21 last Monday to place a hold on the closures of [the Polk and White Haven State Centers](https://www.legis.state.pa.us//cfdocs/Legis/CSM/showMemoPublic.cfm?chamber=S&SPick=20190&cosponId=30476) for people with disabilities. Over the objections of Democrats and Republicans who represent the areas where the centers are located, Wolf will veto the bill. “Governor Wolf agrees that we can continue to improve our community-based care system,” his spokesperson said in an email Tuesday. “Disability experts overwhelmingly agree that community-based care is preferred over institutionalization.”\n\nWolf’s administration said residents at the centers will be immediately placed with a community provider, or, if they choose, at another state center. When — or if — that will happen is unclear: The state is facing a federal civil rights lawsuit to stop the closures, according to [Erie News Now](https://www.erienewsnow.com/story/41592727/commonwealth-faces-lawsuit-over-plan-to-close-state-centers).\n\n### **GOOD FOR VOTERS, TOUGH FOR COUNTIES**\n\nIn 2019, the General Assembly passed a sweeping overhaul of how Pennsylvanians can vote. Among the changes was a provision that will allow anyone to vote by mail-in ballot. While these changes are good for voters, counties are feeling the crunch, [WITF reported](https://www.witf.org/2020/01/28/pa-s-election-head-says-election-overhauls-will-make-2020-primary-tough-for-counties/).\\\n*\\\n**Capitol Notebook by Spotlight PA** provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg.*\n",

			"body": "<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nThe state inspector general’s office, which works to ferret out waste and misconduct in Pennsylvania government programs and agencies, has itself made a costly blunder and left taxpayers on the hook, Spotlight PA has learned.\n\nThe watchdog office spent nearly $160,000 on pistols, ammunition and related equipment that its investigators are not legally allowed to carry. As a result, the weapons have collected dust in storage for nearly two years.\n\nThe purchases were made after a 2017 law expanded the office’s powers, handing it the authority to issue subpoenas and search warrants. At the time, Gov. Tom Wolf said the changes would help the office serve taxpayers with “efficiency and accountability.”\n\nSometime afterward, however, questions arose. The administration determined “the law did not support” arming employees of the office, said Jonathan Hendrickson, a spokesperson for the inspector general.\n\nIt’s unclear why that determination was not made before the state solicited bids and ultimately bought the weapons. Former state Inspector General Bruce Beemer — who led the office at the time of the purchase and who was confirmed in December to become a judge in Allegheny County — did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\n“Somebody has some explaining to do,” said Eric Epstein, a longtime good-government advocate in Harrisburg. \"If you spend $160,000 to buy weapons — and then put them on ice — how is this not a classic example of wasting taxpayer dollars?”\n\n<i><b>» ACT NOW to support accountability journalism that keeps track of your tax dollars in Harrisburg. </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate/\"><i><b>Donate to Spotlight PA and help power more stories like this one</b></i></a><i><b>.</b></i>\n\nIn January 2018, the office sought bids for 145 SIG Sauer P320 Compact pistols, records show. The weapons were bought from Philadelphia-based Firing Line Inc. for just under $57,000, according to a purchase order obtained by Spotlight PA. The office also spent approximately $100,000 on ammunition and auxiliary equipment, the spokesperson, Hendrickson, said.\n\nThe guns were delivered in April 2018 and never put into service. The state has since held them in a “guarded, secure facility,” Hendrickson said, but he declined to say where, citing “safety and security reasons.” The inspector general’s office is working with the general services department to “return or repurpose the firearms,” he said.\n\nThe question of whether to arm inspectors general investigators hangs on the legal authority, their training and the nature of their work, said Carl Bornstein, an adjunct assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\n\n“Typically, if they are investigators, they would be asked in the routine course of their duties to go out into the field and interview people or serve subpoenas,” he said. “Under those circumstances, they may want or need a weapon for self-protection.”\n\nBruce Antkowiak, a former federal prosecutor and head of the criminology department at Saint Vincent College in Westmoreland County, reviewed the 2017 law that expanded the office’s powers and said it lacks express authorization for the investigators to carry weapons. That could put the investigators in a tricky spot, Antkowiak said.\n\n“Nobody wants to go execute a search warrant and not have a firearm on them,\" he said. \"I don’t care how benign the crime may be that you’re investigating — the minute you go into someone’s home or business unannounced, under the authority of the warrant, there’s a serious risk you’re going to meet resistance.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nThe 2017 law gave the office power to investigate and file criminal charges for welfare fraud. The office investigated nearly 23,000 applications in the year after the law went into effect, saving taxpayers more than $75.2 million, according to an annual report.\n\nThe nature of that work makes the weapons purchase particularly concerning, said Louise Hayes, supervising attorney at Community Legal Services, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that advocates for low-income residents.\n\nHayes urged the office to keep the guns in storage.\n\n“The overwhelming majority of benefits recipients are eligible for the benefits they receive, and most investigations reveal no fraud, but perhaps families struggling to comply with a complex web of rules,” she said in a statement. “The carrying of weapons is intimidating, stigmatizing and unnecessary in this context.”\n\nAsked whether the administration would support changing rules to allow the investigators to carry guns, J.J. Abbott, a spokesperson for the governor, said the current law is “sufficient” for the office to perform its duties.\n\nState Sen. Ryan Aument (R., Lancaster), who co-wrote the 2017 law, did not return a request for comment, but a spokesperson said the lawmaker was not aware of the gun purchase.\n\nTaxpayers also have been in the dark. The office’s most recent annual report posted on its website made no mention of the weapons, and the online portal to access state contracts maintained by the state treasurer’s office has no record of the purchase.\n\nThat’s in part because, despite the portal, the treasurer’s office has no authority to ensure state agencies actually upload contracts.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support/\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "***Capitol Notebook by [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/)** provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg. [Sign up for our weekly newsletter.](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters)*\n\nGov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday proposed using $1 billion in state funding, typically set aside for capital projects, to remediate lead- and asbestos-tainted schools, an issue that has been particularly acute in Philadelphia.\n\n“Decades ago, well-intentioned Pennsylvanians constructed our homes, our schools, our water systems, and other structures out of asbestos and lead because we thought they were harmless,” Wolf said. “Now we know the serious harm both cause.”\n\nThe proposal, which comes as Wolf prepares to unveil his 2020-21 budget next week, would make $1 billion in grants available to schools through an expansion of the state’s Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program.\n\n“I think that’s the magnitude of this problem, and this is specifically for toxic schools,” Wolf said.\n\nThe news was welcomed in Philadelphia, where a growing asbestos crisis has [forced the closure of six schools](https://www.inquirer.com/news/asbestos-philadelphia-schools-environmental-crisis-carnell-mcclure-20191220.html) and an early childhood education center since the start of the school year. In September, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers announced that one of its members, [a career Philadelphia teacher, had been diagnosed with mesothelioma](https://www.inquirer.com/education/a/mesothelioma-philadelphia-school-district-lea-dirusso-cancer-20191121.html), a deadly cancer linked to asbestos exposure.\n\nAfter that diagnosis, officials began paying much closer attention to asbestos issues. School District buildings are old and 175 contain asbestos, the district said. Undamaged asbestos is not a threat, but damage can release microscopic fibers that can cause cancer when inhaled.\n\n“I am extremely encouraged that the governor is taking our voices seriously and has developed a plan to bring relief,” said Jerry Jordan, president of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, which is suing the Philadelphia School District over asbestos contamination.\n\n“\\[W]e will also continue to relentlessly pursue immediate relief,\" Jordan added. \"We urge the governor to declare a state of emergency in our schools and utilize the rainy day fund to address the daily crisis that we are facing.”\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney also commended the effort to focus on the state’s aging school buildings.\n\n“These investments can no longer wait, and I sincerely appreciate Gov. Wolf’s leadership on this critical issue. He’s clearly heard and responded to our urgent call for more state support,” Kenney said.\n\nIt was unclear how much support Wolf’s proposal would have in the Republican-controlled legislature. During Wednesday’s news conference, the governor was flanked by fellow Democrats, but no Republican lawmakers were present.\n\nMike Straub, a spokesperson for the state’s House of Representatives majority party, said that House Republicans look forward to discussions with lawmakers and the administration in the upcoming months.\n\n“Discussions around budget priorities and spending are just underway,” he said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nUnder the plan, Wolf also proposed smaller funding investments to address lead and other contaminants in drinking water and in buildings where children are present.\n\nPennsylvania has submitted a grant application to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to fund more voluntary drinking-water testing at 3,000 schools and day-care centers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wolf and other lawmakers spoke about the harms that lead can cause, to young children especially.\n\nState Sen. Vincent Hughes (D., Phila.) invoked the story of Dean Pagan, who suffered long-term health consequences after eating lead chips at Watson Comly Elementary in Northeast Philadelphia. He was featured in [the Inquirer’s “Toxic City” series](https://www.inquirer.com/news/inq/lead-paint-poison-children-asbestos-mold-schools-philadelphia-toxic-city-20180503.html).\n\n“We need to be reminded that although lead paint was banned in 1978, the average age of Pennsylvania schools is 70 years,” he said. “Seventy percent of Pennsylvania’s housing stock was built prior to 1978.

			"blurb": "As Pa. House speaker, Mike Turzai has been perhaps the most powerful and visible conservative leader in the state.",
			"body": "<i><b>Capitol Notebook by </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\" ><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters\" ><i>Sign up for our weekly newsletter.</i></a>\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny), one of Pennsylvania’s most powerful conservative leaders, said Thursday morning that he will not seek reelection and will instead pursue a job in the private sector.\n\nThe announcement, which Turzai made from his suburban Pittsburgh office surrounded by family, confidantes and supporters, immediately raised questions about whether he intends to stay in office until his term ends later this year — and, if he does, whether his search for a private sector position could pose a conflict with his role as Speaker, which gives him the power to decide which bills come to the floor for a vote.\n\nDuring his press conference, Turzai said little about his plans, only noting that, contrary to speculation in the Capitol, he does not have a job offer or specific position.\n\nInstead, Turzai mostly talked about how hard it was to decide not to seek reelection to a job that he has considered a privilege. He was unusually emotional, saying that he had had many discussions with his family over the last few months. One of his sons, he said, made a baseball analogy and told him that the last day he pitches “is going to be so hard — but there is going to be a last day.”\n\n“I am only telling you at this time that I am not running again,” he said, later adding: “I’ve made this decision knowing I’ve left it all on the field.”\n\nWhile hardly a household name, Turzai, 60, has for the better part of a decade helped set the policy agenda in the Capitol on everything from liquor privatization to gas drilling, while championing fiscal restraint  and restrictions on abortion rights.\n\nHe has also been a prolific fund-raiser for Republican legislative candidates across the state, a role he was widely expected to step into again in this critical election year. Democrats need to capture nine GOP seats to to take the House majority, and many of this year’s legislative races are expected to be bare-knuckled and expensive.\n\nA lawyer, Turzai arrived in the House in 2001 after winning a special election, and has been the speaker since 2015. Before that he had been the GOP majority leader for four years.\n\nAs a leader, he managed to control a sometimes unruly and fractured Republican caucus to push through a conservative agenda in the state House.\n\nStaunchly anti-tax, pro-business and a supporter of limited government, Turzai was one of the loudest supporters for breaking the state’s near-monopoly on retail alcohol sales. He also worked to boost tax credits for private school scholarships and was key to blocking an oft-proposed tax on natural gas drillers.\n\nAnd when Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf took office in 2015, Turzai seemed to relish playing the role of foil to the governor’s more progressive agenda. While some of his Republican counterparts, particularly in the Senate, were more open to striking deals with the administration, Turzai was less open to compromise.\n\nCritics have called him mercurial and erratic. During Wolf’s first year in office, Turzai was widely blamed for blowing up budget talks two days before Christmas, prolonging an impasse that left counties, schools and social service non-profits in the lurch.\n\n“Mike Turzai has been the enemy of progress in Pennsylvania,” the state Democratic party said in a statement Thursday.\n\nOver the years, Turzai has flirted with the idea of running for higher office. In 2017, for instance, he declared for the <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/state/mike-turzai-diner-interview-for-governor-race-20171115.html\" >GOP primary for governor in 2017</a> but in the end did not run.\n\nAt his press conference Thursday, the speaker did not say whether he had any political plans. In <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pennsylvania-speaker-of-the-house-mike-turzai-to-retire\" >an interview</a> with the Washington Examiner earlier this week, he said he will not compete in the open race for governor in 2022, despite having evinced interest, including in a <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/clout/pennsylvania-society-mike-turzai-2022-governor-race-20191207.html\" >December interview with Clout</a>, the politics column of the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nThough Turzai’s announcement temporarily quelled rampant speculation about his future that had distracted policy makers in the Capitol all this week, it also left unanswered questions.\n\nTurzai did not take questions from the audience after his press conference, and avoided saying whether he intends to complete his term, which ends Nov. 30th. A spokesman later declined to give any additional information.\n\nThe timing of Turzai’s departure could trigger not just a special election in his district, but an election within the House of Representatives for a new Speaker.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nThe race for the Speaker’s job could be competitive. Several names have already bubbled to the surface as possible replacements: Rep. Stan Saylor, a Republican from York County who runs the powerful House Appropriations Committee; Majority Leader Bryan Cutler (R., Lancaster) — although he only last year assumed the majority leader position, it arguably is almost as powerful as the Speaker’s job; and Rep. Kerry Benninghoff (R., Centre), the House’s majority whip.\n\nAnother scenario that has been discussed: If Turzai retires before his term ends, Republicans could rally behind Rep. Marcy Toepel (R. Montgomery), who has already said she is not running for reelection, to serve as Speaker for the remainder of the year. Then, the fight for the Speaker’s job would be pushed to after the election, when lawmakers would select leaders for the next two-year session, which begins in 2021.\n\nPennsylvania has never had a female House Speaker.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "<a href=\"/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/The Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"/newsletters/\" ><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nLast fall, under scrutiny for its decision years earlier to stop tracking the race of drivers who get pulled over, the Pennsylvania State Police pointed to a series of independent studies that officials said proved there was no consistent bias in the way troopers did their jobs.\n\nBut a review of those studies reveals a far more nuanced picture of what was actually occurring, raising new questions about why the data collection was halted and how troopers are trained to prevent people of certain races from being unfairly targeted.\n\nThe findings, contained in <a href=\"https://interactives.data.spotlightpa.org/2020/psp-citizen-contact-reports/\" >2,000 pages of research</a> produced by the University of Cincinnati and obtained by Spotlight PA under the state public records law, indicated no consistent evidence over the study period that troopers stopped drivers, issued citations or made arrests based on race.\n\nBut they did reveal a persistent problem after stops had occurred: Year after year, according to the reports, troopers were roughly two to three times more likely to search black or Hispanic drivers than white drivers. At the same time, the researchers found, troopers were far less likely to find contraband on black and Hispanic drivers compared to white drivers.\n\n“It’s very concerning,” said Chris Burbank, vice president of the Center for Policing Equity, an organization that helps police departments prevent racial profiling. “But not surprising.”\n\nIn 2002, following scandals in New Jersey over racial profiling by state troopers, the Pennsylvania State Police began collecting data from its hundreds of thousands of traffic stops each year and sending it to the University of Cincinnati for analysis.\n\nA decade later, without making an announcement and for reasons that are still unclear, the agency ended its partnership with the university and stopped collecting the data. In September of last year, in response to <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/09/pa-state-police-stopped-tracking-driver-race/\" >questions from Spotlight PA about why it discontinued the monitoring</a>, the State Police said the researchers had concluded there was no evidence that troopers “were conducting traffic stops based on drivers’ demographics.”\n\nThe agency, however, made no mention of the disparities found during searches. Nor did it mention that researchers noted unexplained increases in stop and arrest rates of black drivers by certain stations in several years. In the final study, analyzing 2010 traffic stops, the researchers noted an unusual department-wide rise in stops of black drivers, although, again, they said they could not explain what was causing the increase.\n\nBecause the data collection ended, it’s impossible to know what has since occurred.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nRobin Engel, a University of Cincinnati criminal justice professor who led the research, did not respond to repeated calls and emails seeking an interview.\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Police said it stood by its September statements that Engel’s research showed no evidence its troopers conducted traffic stops based on race or ethnicity. Asked why it ended its program given the disparities in search rates, Lt. Col. Scott Price reiterated that the decision was made by executive staff at the time and that the full rationale remains unknown.\n\n“We have not found documentation that points to a single reason that drove the decision,” Price said in a statement.\n\nIn the final years of data analysis, researchers recommended the State Police conduct a more detailed review to determine which stations had the greatest racial disparities in search rates and then interview the commanders there to better understand why those disparities might exist. Price said he didn’t know what, if anything, was done in response to the recommendations.\n\nHe reiterated that the State Police would resume collecting race data this year, and that it is currently seeking a contractor to analyze that data, just as the University of Cincinnati had done in the past. The agency <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/09/pa-state-police-stopped-tracking-driver-race/\" >first announced its decision to resume data collection last year</a> in response to inquiries from Spotlight PA.\n\nA survey at the time found the State Police was one of only 11 statewide law enforcement agencies in the U.S. — and by far the largest — that did not collect race data during stops.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month on WITF, Central Pennsylvania’s public radio station, the president of the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association, David Kennedy, also pointed to the University of Cincinnati research as proof troopers don't pull drivers over based on their race.\n\n\"The overwhelming numbers were in the Pennsylvania State Police's favor,\" Kennedy said. \"We do not pull people over because of their color.\"\n\nWhen later asked by Spotlight PA about the disparities in search rates, Kennedy issued a statement saying, “Troopers go to work everyday ready to sacrifice their lives for their fellow Pennsylvanians.”\n\n“They do so without regard to race or ethnicity,” Kennedy said. “We recognize that we will always have our critics, but that's part of the job. We won't change our focus on keeping Pennsylvania safe.\"\n\n<b>» </b><i><b>WE DEPEND ON YOU to support accountability journalism like this report on the State Police. </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate\" ><i><b>Donate now and support our team of journalists</b></i></a><i><b> in the state capital.</b></i>\n\nBurbank, of the Center for Policing Equity, said the search rate disparities were alarming because it meant troopers were potentially taking action based on little more than the color of a driver’s skin. Searches like those are not only unconstitutional but self-defeating: they erode the trust that black and Hispanic drivers have in the police, he said, meaning in the future those people might be less likely to report crimes or provide information to officers to solve cases.\n\n“That cost to society is significant,” said Burbank, a former police chief in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nSome question more generally whether the State Police has been too slow to improve bias-based training and awareness.\n\nCurrently, cadets are presented with information within the first few weeks of academy training on the importance of non-biased policing and how to be aware of implicit biases. They do not receive additional anti-bias training throughout their career, though Price said the State Police is now developing such a continuing education plan.\n\nWitold Walczak, the legal director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said it was irresponsible that the nation’s third-largest statewide law enforcement agency was only now developing that curriculum and resuming its analysis of traffic stops.\n\n“To say, ‘we are not going to study this,’ or take affirmative measures to combat it is putting your head in the sand,” Walczak said of State Police officials.\n\n{{<tips-inline>}} <b>Do you have a story about the Pennsylvania State Police</b> that you think we should cover? Reach our newsroom now by using the form below. {{</tips-inline>}}\n\nLast summer, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against the State Police alleging troopers were violating the law by stopping and holding people solely because they were Latinx.\n\nIt isn’t the first time in recent years that the State Police has faced allegations of racial bias.\n\nIn 2017, for example, the agency paid out $150,000 to settle a lawsuit brought by Wilfredo Ramos, a Latino man from Brooklyn, who alleged he was profiled by troopers and arrested on false charges. Ramos spent five months in prison, losing his job and apartment, before he was acquitted.\n\nRamos alleged that those failures were as much a result of the actions of individual troopers as they were the agency’s systemic failure to properly train troopers and monitor them for racially biased policing.\n\n<i>Spotlight PA reporter Matt McKinney contributed to this story.</i>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "\nThe House returned to session this week for the first time in 2020, and if the opening week was any indication, it could be a long, bruising year between Republicans who control the chamber and Democrats seeking to snag the majority away in the upcoming election. Here are the highlights from the week:\n\n## Cell Phone Ban\n\nHouse lawmakers were sharply divided over <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/01/pa-house-votes-to-stop-drivers-use-of-handheld-phones.html\">a bill to ban using hand-held cell phones while driving</a>. Though it was approved by a 120-74 vote, there was plenty of frustration, from those concerned about racial profiling to others worried it would weaken existing rules banning texting and driving.\n\n## Erasing the Vote\n\nA heated disagreement broke out over House Speaker Mike Turzai’s <a href=\"https://whyy.org/articles/pa-democrats-say-house-speaker-struck-failed-gop-votes-from-the-record/\"  >decision to strike from the record what many thought was an official vote on two separate bills</a> — both sponsored by Republicans — effectively making it seem like there was never a vote on them at all. The move prompted confusion and disbelief from representatives who had voted against the two measures.\n\nOne of the bills aimed to keep some violent offenders in prison longer, and the other was an amendment to a bill sponsored by Turzai to provide scholarships to help Harrisburg public school students attend private schools.\n\nSome Democrats believe Turzai made the move when it became clear the vote wasn’t going in Republicans’ favor. Republicans countered that there were lawmakers who wanted to speak on the bill before the vote occurred. The House’s parliamentarian, Clancy Myer, who is the arbiter of such disputes, said, \"during the past 40 years, five other Speakers from both political parties have had the vote stricken under similar circumstances.\"\n\n## Mental Health\n\nWolf administration officials <a href=\"https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/01/02/Governor-wolf-pennsylvania-mental-health-services/stories/202001020126\"  >released preliminary findings by the governor’s Suicide Prevention Task Force</a>. It highlighted eight takeaways gained from more than 800 comments gathered at statewide public listening sessions and submitted online. Key themes included elevating mental health as a public health issue, reducing stigma, and most controversially, introducing a Red Flag law that would allow for firearms to be taken from those at risk of dying by suicide.\n\n## Next Week\n\nThe House could vote on a bill protecting mothers who have had a child as a result of rape or incest, a measure urging the attorney general to file lawsuits against drug companies complicit in the opioid crisis, a bill expanding the rights of patients receiving mental health care, and a bill to repeal a 100-year-old law meant to prevent \"immoral persons\" at dance clubs.\n\nWe'll spare you our terrible dance moves.\n\n_Capitol Notebook by Spotlight PA provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg.

That makes it impossible to know how many groups may be falling short of the requirements.\n\nThe problems extend beyond York County. Documents obtained under a public records request show complaints to the Department of Human Services from all corners alleging volunteers lack clearances.\n\nViolations can be prosecuted by local district attorneys, but none have brought such a case since the law took effect, according to state court records.\n\n“Is this an issue? A hundred percent,” York County District Attorney Dave Sunday said in an interview. “Is this something that needs to be worked through and figured out, and do people need to be held accountable? Yes.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nThe law requires anyone working with children in the public, private or nonprofit sector, including volunteers, to undergo a criminal background check by the State Police and a child abuse clearance by the Department of Welfare. Some are also required to get a third check by the FBI. The clearances are good for 60 months and must be on file with the organization before volunteers start their work.\n\nThe mandate was hailed as a major step forward in protecting children, and few question the value of it. But, as those in York County and elsewhere have found, its effectiveness relies on trust — not actual enforcement.\n\n“There is a good-faith presumption written directly in \\[the law] that these groups are required to obtain and maintain clearances,” said Amy Grippi, the executive director of child services for the human services department.\n\nGrippi said entities already regulated by the state, such as daycares and residential homes for children, are regularly checked to ensure they are properly collecting and keeping clearances on file as part of annual inspections.\n\nBut overseeing other private and nonprofit groups that are not already subject to state oversight would be a major undertaking and require more resources.\n\n“There are probably thousands of such programs and services,” said Grippi, adding that one line of defense for parents concerned about their child’s safety is to directly ask youth groups about their policies on clearances.\n\n{{<picture src=\"2020/01/david-sunday.jpeg\" caption=\"York County District Attorney David Sunday said more needs to be done to enforce background check requirements for those working with children, including volunteers.\" description=\"York County District Attorney David Sunday said more needs to be done to enforce background check requirements for those working with children, including volunteers.\" credit=\"KALIM A. BHATTI / For The Inquirer\">}}\n\n### LOST APPLICATIONS\n\nThe emails obtained by the news organizations show that was the case last year with the Boy Scouts’ New Birth of Freedom Council, which covers portions of south-central Pennsylvania, including the York region.\n\nThe council has 9,000 youth members and has more than 3,500 registered adult volunteers.\n\nThe emails describe how clearance applications, which contain sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, for the York-based troop had been lost or misplaced, and how volunteers had overseen children without clearances on file.\n\nThe documents show at least three people with leadership positions in the York County troop contacted the New Birth of Freedom Council's top staff to report missing clearances and volunteers who should never have been able to attend trips.\n\nRon Gardner, the CEO of the <a href=\"https://newbirthoffreedom.org/\" >New Birth of Freedom Council</a>, responded to one of the emails saying he was unhappy about the situation.\n\nOther emails from early 2019 assert that one scoutmaster went on a two-day overnight trip, even though some of his clearances had expired. And in an email just this month, a York-based troop member complained that one of its leaders had attended a two-day camp last summer thinking his clearances were on file, when, in fact, New Birth of Freedom Council officials had no record of them.\n\n<b>» </b><i><b>WE DEPEND ON YOU to </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate\"><i><b>help pay for future investigations by Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i><b> that hold the powerful in Pennsylvania to account. </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate\" ><i><b>Donate now</b></i></a><i><b> and support our team of journalists in the state capital.</b></i>\n\nIn an interview in November, Gardner acknowledged that keeping track of clearance applications after the requirement took effect in 2015 had been difficult, and that the Council initially dedicated more resources to stay on top of them.\n\nHe also said he was not aware of problems where clearance applications had been lost, potentially allowing for volunteers to go on trips without them on file.\n\nWhen sent follow-up questions citing the email chains supplied to the news organizations, Gardner confirmed that a troop leader did, in fact, not have clearances on file when he participated in an overnight trip. He said the council warned the troop leader prior to the trip that his clearance was expiring, and that the clearance has since been obtained.\n\nGardner said in a statement that the safety of troops is paramount, and that the Boy Scouts of America employs “a multi-layered process of safeguards that serve as barriers to abuse” that, in addition to background checks, includes training and other programs.\n\nGardner also said individual troops share the responsibility of ensuring clearances are appropriately maintained. Unit leaders themselves are volunteers.\n\n“At the unit level, it is the responsibility of the unit committee chair and chartered organization representative to ensure that compliance is handled before the individual can begin volunteering,” he said.\n\nGardner declined to answer specific questions about whether he had been notified by troop leaders about clearances that were not on file. He also declined to say whether he had met with the leaders to address the issues.\n\n### MORE COMPLAINTS\n\nConcern over who is monitoring to ensure backgrounds checks are completed extends statewide. The Department of Human Services received at least five complaints in 2019 about volunteers allegedly lacking proper clearances, according to records released under the Right to Know law.\n\n{{<tips-inline>}} <b>» </b><i><b>WE WANT TO KNOW MORE about groups that are not obtaining or maintaining proper background checks.</b></i> If you have information or a tip we should pursue, send us a note now. {{</tips-inline>}}\n\nOne was from an administrative assistant in Allegheny County who processes summer camp referrals for foster children in the county’s care. Another was from a Philadelphia resident who had children involved in sports.\n\nA third was from a retired county detective who had investigated crimes against children. In a May 12 email last year, he wrote: “I am very concerned that youth programs do not take the required clearances seriously.”\n\nIn almost every instance, the department did not intervene, instead telling them to either address it directly with the organization, contact the organization’s insurance carrier — which often requires them to properly maintain clearances — or report the organization to the local district attorney’s office.\n\nIn one candid response, a state Human Services department employee wrote: “We find that the area of enforcing this law (especially as it pertains to clearances) is one which requires strengthening.”\n\nThe employee added: “Some of the difficulty is that the PSP \\[Pennsylvania State Police] and/or the District Attorney may not have the time or resources to charge a person or agency in a case such as this and therefore the law continues to be broken.”\n\nSunday, York County’s district attorney, said the state should implement a clear and confidential way to report non-compliance, and also require that it be reported to police. But even when complaints are filed, they rarely prompt action.\n\nSo far, no one has been prosecuted for violating the law, according to data maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.pacourts.us/judicial-administration/\" >Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts</a>.\n\nBucks County District Attorney Matt Weintraub said it would be difficult to successfully prosecute someone under the law as written because it states that an employer’s failure to get clearances from staffers or volunteers is a crime if it is “intentional.”\n\n“There has to be willful violation of the law,” he said, adding that a prosecutor would have to pitch the equivalent of “a perfect game” to win.\n\nTime and resources are also a factor, said Tom Hogan, who retired last month as Chester County’s District Attorney after completing two terms. New laws enacted after the Penn State scandal “exponentially increased” prosecutors’ workloads, Hogan said.\n\nComplaints about clearances, he said, can get “dropped further down the list of priorities.”\n\n“You have to take care of the biggest forest fire first, and the candle burning in the corner … gets less attention,” Hogan said.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "This is the year nearly everyone working in Pennsylvania government and politics has been waiting for: from the decennial census to control of the state legislature, Congress and the White House, 2020 promises to be breathtakingly busy. And Pennsylvania is widely expected to be at the center of the national news cycle.\n\nNext week, the state legislature returns to the Capitol after a lengthy break for the holidays. On the policy front, few believe lawmakers will move substantive legislation. Traditionally, legislators have shied away from tackling particularly complicated or costly problems in election years, lest it hurt their reelection chances.\n\nStill, Gov. Wolf, a Democrat, in early February is scheduled to deliver his budget address to a joint session of the Republican-controlled legislature, and budget negotiations will dominate the agenda. In his second and final term, the governor is expected to again make a push for some of his key priorities, including some that have repeatedly been rejected by GOP lawmakers.\n\nWolf, for instance, is again poised to push for a tax on the extraction of natural gas (he’s done so every year since taking office in 2015). He would then use the proceeds to bankroll infrastructure improvements. The proposed tax has been deeply unpopular with many Republicans, who believe it will drive away an industry that is integral to the state’s economy.\n\nWolf also is likely to argue for gun control reforms, which, for years, have gained no traction in the Capitol. He will also advocate for a minimum wage hike. (The Senate approved an increase late last year from the current $7.25 per hour to $9.50 per hour; it is unclear whether the House will act on it.)\n\nBut the more bruising fight is expected in the political arena.\n\nThere are several high-profile congressional races across the state that will be watched nationally. And in Harrisburg, Democrats believe they can take back control of the state House of Representatives, where Republicans currently hold 107 of 203 seats (there are four vacancies because of resignations).\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats say they still see a path to taking control of the chamber, despite the high-profile defection of longtime Sen. John Yudichak (D., Luzerne), who announced late last year that he was becoming an independent and now caucuses with Republicans.\n\nControl of the chambers is key. Once this year’s census is complete, the legislature will redraw maps for legislative and congressional districts, and the party that controls the statehouse will have an advantage in the process.\n\n_Capitol Notebook by Spotlight PA provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg.

			"body": "<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\" ><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nNearly 150,000 Medicaid recipients in Pennsylvania could  be forced to change their prescription medications in the new year, the result of new regulations that the state says will cut down on health-care costs but that many physicians are concerned could harm patient care.\n\nBeginning Jan. 1, the State Department of Human Services will require the eight companies that manage pharmacy benefits under Medicaid in the state to use the same preferred prescription drug list — essentially, drugs that will be automatically covered — instead of their own individual lists.\n\nAs a result, some drugs currently provided will no longer be available without a special exception.  That could  force an estimated 150,000 of the state’s 2.8 million Medicaid recipients to switch to new medications, state officials said. Among that group, approximately 40,000 could  have to switch multiple medications.\n\nThe change is widely seen as beneficial in the long term, simplifying care and decreasing health-care costs. When there are multiple options within a class of drugs, the preferred list mostly prioritizes cheaper options and makes them automatically available, while requiring doctors to seek special approval for coverage of more expensive drugs.\n\nThe Department of Human Services estimates that the new approach could  save the state $85 million a year. Although <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/business/health/pennsylvania-medicaid-drug-benefits-managed-care-amerihealth-caritas-20191009.html\" >there is some disagreement over that figure</a>, physicians say the real concern is that the quick rollout of the new list could delay access to critical medications.\n\nSome of those affected may find a drug similar to their current medication on the new list, but not everyone will find an appropriate replacement, said Mary Stock Keister, president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Family Physicians and a practicing doctor at a family health center in Allentown.\n\n“I worry there will be gaps in care,” Keister said. “We always have to balance cost savings with the danger to patients of changing medications. I hope this doesn’t change what I do in seeing patients and deciding on the best option for them.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nFor instance, Keister said, the new list is missing certain concentrations of long-acting insulin that she recommends to many of her diabetic patients, and it has only one class of oral osteoporosis medication.\n\nEd Balaban, a licensed physician and a consultant for the Penn State Cancer Institute, said in a field such as oncology, where new drugs are rolled out every few months, the fact that the drug list will be updated only once a year means the latest treatments will be missing. And more choices also allow patients to find a medication with the fewest side effects, he said.\n\n“The unfortunate reality in medical care is a lot of decisions are economically based rather than therapeutically based,” Balaban said.\n\n<a href=\"https://papdl.com/preferred-drug-list\" >The new drug list</a> — compiled by a committee of doctors, pharmacists and consumer representatives — doesn’t prevent patients from accessing other drugs, but it makes it harder. To get a “non-preferred,” drug, a doctor has to submit a request to the company that handles pharmacy benefits, justifying the need for that medication, and the company needs to approve it.\n\nMany physicians worry that their requests will be denied because the state, under the new regulations, is requiring the companies to adhere to the preferred drug list 95% of the time. If they fall below that rate, the companies could face fines starting at $1,000 a day.\n\n<b>» </b><i><b>BECOME A DONOR to Spotlight PA and </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate\" ><i><b>support more in-depth reporting about our state government and how it affects people across Pennsylvania</b></i></a><i><b>. This news can’t wait.</b></i>\n\n“In order to get the highest number of people on the preferred drug list, I worry there will be a tightening of what will be approved for off-list use,” Keister said.\n\nSally Kozak, deputy secretary for Pennsylvania’s Office of Medical Assistance Programs, said the state’s goal is not to penalize companies. Monitoring for compliance won’t begin until July 2020, she said, and if off-list medications are approved for true medical necessity, it won’t count against the companies.\n\nEven if the state finds improper approval of off-list medications, she said, the first step will be to have a conversation rather than simply issue a fine. Still, at <a href=\"https://www.pasenategop.com/blog/102319-4/\" >a Senate committee hearing</a> in October on the new preferred drug list, physicians said the 95% threshold was a significant concern.\n\nIn written testimony, Johanna Kelly from Reading Pediatrics Inc. said that medicines used for children with autism or mental illness almost always require special approval.\n\n“We will exceed our 5% allowed very quickly,” <a href=\"https://dingo.telicon.com/PA/library/2019/20191023TQ.PDF\" >she wrote</a>, “and if this population of children do not remain on their medicine or can’t get medicine they need, we will have a disaster on our hands.”\n\nEven if requests for off-list medications are approved, Balaban said, waiting for the approval creates a delay. In <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2019-02/prior-auth-2018.pdf\" >surveys by national</a> and <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WrCMw6kM6XgJ:pafp.com/images/2018MediaReleaseSurveyPriorAuth.pdf\">local physician groups</a>, doctors say the approval process delays necessary care about 90% of the time.\n\n“Cancer patients may not have that kind of time frame to wait and see,” Balaban said.\n\nThe Department of Human Services said it has tried to account for these concerns by grandfathering in some medications, meaning that people who were already using certain drugs that are no longer on the list will be allowed to continue without special approval.\n\nThat significantly reduced the worries for many pediatricians, said Deborah Moss, president of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Still, other physicians say they’d prefer the compliance rate be lowered to 80%.\n\nPatients affected by the change were notified by mail this fall and given a list of any medications that would  need to be changed. And if patients run into issues come Jan. 1, there are laws in place to protect them, said Laval Miller-Wilson of the Pennsylvania Health Law Project, which provides free legal counsel to Medicaid recipients.\n\nPatients can request a 15-day emergency supply of their old medication while figuring out how to move forward with their doctor, he said.\n\n<iframe title=\"How To Get Help\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-Sa3t8\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Sa3t8/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"433\"></iframe>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n!(function() {\n  \"use strict\";\n  window.addEventListener(\"message\", function(a) {\n    if (void 0 !== a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])\n      for (var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]) {\n        var t =\n          document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\" + e) ||\n          document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + e + \"']\");\n        t && (t.style.height = a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e] + \"px\");\n      }\n  });\n})();\n</script>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/The Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/\" ><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nIn a half hour meeting, the Commonwealth Financing Authority — Pennsylvania’s mammoth economic development engine — can approve millions of dollars for projects ranging from local sewer systems and parking lots to dairy farms and downtown facelifts.\n\nBut recently, long delays between meetings have held up funding for projects. And the resulting finger-pointing over who is to blame provides a glimpse into the politics surrounding the hundreds of millions of dollars the authority doles out each year.\n\nIn particular, some familiar with the process say that nearly all deliberation and decision-making about which projects to support generally take place behind closed doors, making the public board meetings largely ceremonial.\n\nWhen board members disagree, meetings are sometimes cancelled rather than letting those disagreements spill into the public forum, they say. As a result, a handful of disputed projects can sometimes delay the entire agenda.\n\n“When the board goes for months without meeting and then meets just to approve things unanimously, it leads us to believe deliberation that ought to be public record is being intentionally pushed into secret,” said Andrew Abramczyk, a senior policy analyst at the <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfoundation.org/\" >Commonwealth Foundation</a>, a conservative think tank.\n\nCreated in 2004 as part of former Gov. Ed Rendell’s economic stimulus plan, the authority is now one of the largest grantors of public money for economic development and infrastructure projects. This year alone, it has doled out nearly $284 million in state funding, significantly more than the Department of Community and Economic Development.\n\n{{<tips-inline>}}\n<b>» </b><i><b>WE WANT TO KNOW MORE about the Commonwealth Financing Authority and how it operates.</b></i> If you have information about this story or another we should pursue, send a comment or <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/tips\" ><i><b>contact our team</b></i></a><i><b>.</b></i>\n{{</tips-inline>}}\n\nThe authority is staffed by state employees in the department who review applications and make recommendations. But final decision-making power rests with the authority’s seven-member board. Three board members — the secretaries of banking, budget, and economic development — are appointed by the governor. The other four are chosen by the leaders of each of the legislative caucuses.\n\nBut not all board members have the same power.\n\nIn order to garner support for the authority’s creation, Rendell struck a deal with the Republican-controlled legislature at the time: Projects would need five votes for final approval, with all four of the legislative appointees voting in favor.\n\nThat essentially gives each of them veto power: without consensus, nothing can get done.\n\nSome say this structure works well, forcing compromise and bipartisan cooperation. Others complain that it makes the process more political, and the horse-trading required to get everyone on board slows down approvals. Demand for funding from the authority usually far exceeds the amount of money available, creating intense competition.\n\nThe board usually meets every other month, but recently, meetings have been repeatedly cancelled, leaving months-long stretches during which no funding can be given out. The board did not meet between September 2015 and July 2016, a gap of almost 10 months. In 2017, more than five months elapsed between meetings. And, after meeting in September 2018, the board did not meet again until this past March, a six-month delay.\n\nIn April, House Speaker Mike Turzai (R., Allegheny) <a href=\"https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2019&sInd=0&body=H&type=B&bn=1045\" >introduced legislation</a> that would require the authority to meet six times a year. At only 40 words, the bill itself is straightforward. It passed the House in the spring, and was advanced by a Senate committee last month.\n\nBut few can agree on why the authority’s board needs a legislative slap on the wrist in the first place, especially since the legislative appointees wield so much power.\n\nIn a <a href=\"http://www.repturzai.com/News/13879/Press-Releases/Turzai-Bill-to-Ensure-Timely-Action-on-Economic-Development-Project-Funding-Earns-House-Approval\" >press release</a> announcing the bill, Turzai said “there is no reason to delay or cancel meetings because board members intend to vote against certain proposed projects.” But in an interview, he backed off, saying this was “second or third-hand” information.\n\nTurzai blamed the governor’s office and Dennis Davin, the secretary of the state’s economic development department<b>, </b>who chairs the board and is responsible for scheduling meetings.\n\n“The delays are due to the fact that the governor’s office doesn’t want everyone to meet for a variety of reasons,” he said, without going into specifics.\n\nDavin, however, disputed Turzai’s contention, saying it’s the legislative appointees who are responsible for the delays because the board cannot meet unless all four are present. When they aren’t available, he said, meetings have to be cancelled.\n\n“They know upfront when all the meetings are,” he said. “We expect all of them to attend.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nA spokeswoman for Joe Scarnati, the Republican leader of the Senate, said in a statement that meetings are sometimes delayed because more time is needed to reach a consensus.\n\nBut Scarnati’s appointee to the board, D. Raja, said he’s “really not sure” why meetings have been delayed. Regardless, he said he supports Turzai’s bill.\n\nIn a statement, a spokeswoman for Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny) echoed Davin’s argument. Costa’s board appointee, Austin Burke, declined to comment. And a spokesman for House Minority Leader Frank Dermody (D., Allegheny) said House Democrats overwhelmingly support mandating a regular meeting schedule.\n\n“It’s always challenging to reach consensus when there are competing interests, but the CFA over a period of years has managed to do that work,” the spokesman, Bill Patton, said. “Each of the projects stands on their own and if you have a regular meeting schedule, that should keep things moving fairly well.”\n\nDermody’s appointee to the board, Marc Little, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTurzai’s appointee to the authority’s board, Philadelphia real estate developer Michael Karp, said in a statement that he agreed with the speaker’s intention that meetings should be held regularly, even if board members disagree about some projects, “so that other projects that are not in contention can be voted on.”\n\nKarp tends to be one of the more outspoken board members: questioning, for instance, if private companies should receive loans instead of grants, and often asking for more financial information from applicants. When there have been dissenting votes, they often have come from him.\n\nBut meeting minutes from the past few years show public dissent is rare. Board meetings tend to be cordial and brisk, with unanimous votes on blocks of dozens of projects at once, often with little discussion.\n\nAs of September, the last time a board member voted against a project was four years ago.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

			"body": "<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\" target=_blank><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nHARRISBURG — The state Senate on Wednesday confirmed Gov. Wolf’s controversial pick to fill a vacancy on a statewide appellate court, even as a group of senators criticized the secrecy surrounding the judicial nominating process and said they will introduce a bill to make it more transparent.\n\nDrew Crompton, 51, the top lawyer and strategist to the lead Republican in the Senate, cleared the final hurdle to fill a vacant spot on the state’s Commonwealth Court, which hears cases involving government agencies, including state agencies.\n\nHis nomination last month sparked an outcry among some Democrats who criticized it as a blatantly political choice and questioned his qualifications and impartiality. The pick renewed concerns about Pennsylvania’s judicial nominating process, which <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/11/wolf-judicial-vacancies-drew-crompton-commonwealth-court/\" target=_blank>unfolds almost entirely behind closed doors</a>.\n\n“It is a system that is dangerous, corrosive, antiquated and doesn’t meet the standard if we want the best people on the bench,” Sen. Anthony Williams (D., Philadelphia) said at an afternoon news conference.\n\nWilliams is one of four senators who said they will introduce a bill to make the process more transparent. The measure would require the governor’s office to publicly post on its website the names of all applicants for a judicial vacancy, as well as the extensive paperwork they must fill out when they apply.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nThe public would then have 30 days to comment on the applications before the governor decides who to nominate. That would be followed by a televised public hearing that includes a question-and-answer session with the nominees.\n\nAs it stands now, when a vacancy occurs on the bench, the governor solicits applications to fill the positions, but does not make them public. Instead, the administration, together with the top Senate leaders from both parties, eventually hammer out a deal behind closed doors — and with no public input — on who to ultimately nominate to fill the spots.\n\nBy the time the nominations are sent to Senate, which must approve them, the votes have been shored up and the confirmation process becomes largely ceremonial. Crompton was confirmed by a 42-7 vote.\n\n“Becoming a judge should not involve who you know, and it should not involve backdoor deals, and it should not involve getting something handed to you. You should be judged on merit, your ethics and your moral compass,” said Sen. Katie Muth (D., Montgomery), one of the supporters of changing the nominating process.\n\nIt is unclear whether the Democratic senators’ proposal has a chance of passing. Jennifer Kocher, the spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre), said Republicans would review the measure once it is formally introduced. Wolf’s office said it is “open” to discussing reforms.\n\nBut historically, the legislature has turned a deaf ear to calls for changing the system for how judges are chosen.\n\nWolf has been largely silent on why he chose Crompton, a Republican lawyer who has worked in the Senate for 26 years. For much of that time, Crompton has been a key strategist for both the Senate Republican caucus’ policy and politics, serving as both chief counsel and chief of staff to Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson).\n\nIn his position, Crompton weighs in on nearly every significant piece of legislation pushed by Republicans in the chamber. He has helped draft hundreds of key policies on everything from the environment to education to elections.\n\nHe has also been deeply involved in handling some of the Senate’s messiest personnel problems, including a recent sexual harassment scandal in which Republicans, in a controversial move, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/pa-senate-pays-legal-bills-former-employee-accused-sexual-harassment-20190214.html\" target=_blank>quietly decided to pay the legal bills</a> of the person accused of harassment.\n\nDuring his years in the Capitol, Crompton has amassed both loyal supporters and fierce critics. The former believe he is smart and will bring a thoughtful, reasoned approach to the bench. His critics take aim at his lack of judicial experience and believe it will be difficult for him to be impartial.\n\nDuring a hearing in the Senate Judiciary committee Wednesday, Crompton said he would recuse himself “when warranted.” Pressed to elaborate, he said he would step away from deciding any cases involving laws or policies he has been closely involved in drafting.\n\nHe also pushed back on criticisms that he is too partisan, saying much of his work in the Senate involved “bipartisan work on behalf of the institution of the Senate, on behalf of the legislative branch and sometimes in conjunction with the executive branch, Republican or Democrat.”\n\n“Some of this does, in fact, come down to integrity,\" Crompton told members of the committee. \"... I believe the people who have worked closest with me understand the integrity that I have operated with for two decades. And I plan on taking my personal integrity to the judicial branch and separating myself from my prior life.”\n\nOnce he is sworn in, Crompton will serve through 2021, at which point he will have to decide whether to run for a full term.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

Gene DiGirolamo took office in 1995, one of the first visitors at the Capitol was Deb Beck. She wanted to discuss drug and alcohol treatment. DiGirolamo, a Republican from Bucks County, politely listened, filed away her card and moved on to his next meeting.\n\nNearly a year later, he found himself hunting through his office desk for that card: His eldest son had relapsed in his heroin addiction and DiGirolamo knew he needed to get him help, fast. DiGirolamo called Beck, who within days helped his son get back into a treatment center in Bensalem.\n\n“Deb and I started to talk every day after that,” said DiGirolamo, now chair of the House Human Services Committee, which handles addiction-related legislation. “And we continue to do that 25 years later.”\n\nBeck, 69, is a formidable power player in Harrisburg, influencing the state’s response to a drug addiction epidemic that has led to thousands of deaths and spawned a multimillion dollar treatment industry. She’s been in the field since 1971, and whenever lawmakers want to draft addiction-related laws, or need to get a loved one into treatment, they go to her.\n\nNow — with the state pumping huge sums of taxpayer money into treatment for opioid addiction and paying greater attention to how best to reverse the deadly trend — some are questioning if Beck is using her sway to help patients or the businesses providing care.\n\nIn particular, her advocacy for long-term residential care for those suffering from opioid addiction has prompted concerns that she’s pushing an outdated treatment model over approaches that medical professionals say are far more effective.\n\n“I used to think of Deb Beck as someone who advocates for addicted patients,” said Frederic Baurer, president of the Pennsylvania Society of Addiction Medicine and a practicing doctor at a treatment facility in Philadelphia. “Perhaps that was naive of me.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nSince 1986, Beck has headed the nonprofit Drug and Alcohol Service Providers Organization of Pennsylvania. Tax records show Beck is the group’s only paid member, earning more than $220,000 in each of the past three years. Beck is also the group’s only registered lobbyist, spending about $100,000 a year in lobbying expenses in Harrisburg.\n\nBeck declined to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20191119025810/https://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/on-drug-abuse-policy-one-group-wields-enormous-clout-but-is-shrouded-in-mystery\" >provide a list of all of the organization’s members</a>, so it’s hard to know whose interests she represents as a lobbyist.\n\nShe said the group includes a cross section of the addiction field, ranging from more than 300 drug and alcohol treatment providers — outpatient clinics and long-term residential facilities — to prevention and education advocates. Others in the field, however, said the group is primarily focused on the business interests of long-term, abstinence-focused treatment facilities, and that has become a point of conflict.\n\nFor decades, extended residential treatment was the bedrock of addiction care. In recent years, though, public health officials have turned to medication-assisted treatment as <a href=\"https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/sites/default/files/Spotlight-on-Opioids_09192018.pdf\" >the best bet to stem the opioid crisis</a>. Studies <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670653/#bib17\" >in the US</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/04/how-france-reduced-heroin-overdoses-by-79-in-four-years/558023/\" >around the world</a> have shown this approach, which combines medication and therapy, can reduce relapses and overdoses <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2016/11/medication-assisted-treatment-improves-outcomes-for-patients-with-opioid-use-disorder\" >more effectively than counseling alone</a>.\n\nYet Beck’s group has been reluctant to embrace it.\n\n“Her organization represents the interests of the rehab industry,” Baurer said, “and in recent years these interests have often clashed with best practices for patient care.”\n\nMedication-assisted treatment doesn't require someone to be admitted to a hospital or spend weeks at a residential facility, making it less disruptive to their life. Jennifer Smith, secretary of the state Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs, said research on the treatment’s benefits is clear.\n\n“The fact that at this point in time [Beck’s group] is still dragging their heels in embracing it, leads me to believe there is more to the story,” Smith said. “There’s some other reason they can’t accept this is what the science shows.”\n\n{{<donate-inline>}}\n\nBeck said she’s not opposed to that kind of treatment, and several facilities represented by her organization offer it. But, she said, too often it’s delivered without proper counseling. And since the medication used is most effective in treating opioid addiction, it doesn’t help the many people who use other drugs or multiple drugs at the same time, Beck said.\n\n“People always want a quick fix, and they like treatments that are new and shiny,” she said. “But without the meat and potatoes of a full continuum of care, it’s not going to work.”\n\n### ‘Unbridled control’\n\nQuestions of Beck’s influence in Harrisburg have lingered for years.\n\nIn June 2016, Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160706015823/http://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/pa-senator-blasts-states-response-to-heroin-addiction\" >wrote a letter</a> to Gov. Tom Wolf complaining that Beck’s group wielded “unbridled control” over the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs.\n\nThe agency, which was previously an office under the Department of Health, was created in 2012, in large part due to Beck’s advocacy. DiGirolamo sponsored the bill creating the department, but “it was [Beck’s] idea,” he said, and “she was absolutely the person who helped me put the bill together.”\n\nThe idea was to have a department that could focus solely on addiction and elevate its importance, DiGirolamo said. (DiGirolamo was recently elected a Bucks County Commissioner and will be leaving the House in January.)\n\n{{<picture src=\"2019/12/deb-beck2.jpeg\" caption=\"Deb Beck (center) and Rep. Gene DiGirolamo (center right) at a 2017 rally opposing Gov. Tom Wolf's proposal to consolidate the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs with another agency.\" description=\"Deb Beck (center) and Rep. Gene DiGirolamo (center right) at a 2017 rally opposing Gov. Tom Wolf's proposal to consolidate the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs with another agency.\" credit=\"Courtesy Gene DiGirolamo\">}}\n\nIn his letter, Scarnati argued that Beck’s group used its influence over the department to funnel funding toward long-term residential treatment centers. Gary Tennis, the drug and alcohol secretary at the time, refuted the claim.\n\nSeven months later, The Reading Eagle reported that Tennis directed a prospective employee <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20191213130802/https://www.readingeagle.com/news/article/ex-state-employee-says-she-interviewed-with-a-lobbyist\" >to interview with Beck</a> in order to land the job.\n\nIn an interview with Spotlight PA, Tennis said the decision to hire the applicant was made well before the meeting and he suggested meeting Beck only as a way to prepare for the job.\n\n“I would never have a lobbyist interview and check somebody out,” he said, “and I don’t think Deb would do it even if I asked her.”\n\nBeck’s supporters say allegations of her having undue power come from people who are jealous of her access.\n\n“If people say she has too much influence, then they’re not doing their jobs,” said George Kenney, former Republican chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee from 2002 to 2008. “She’s too good at what she does? Is that what they’re saying?”\n\nBeck commands deep respect in Harrisburg, in part, because she’s been in the field for decades, long before most people cared about addiction, Kenney said.\n\n“Even today if a legislator calls me with a [drug or alcohol] issue, I tell them to call Deb Beck,” Kenney said. “No one jumps out as being in the same space as her.”\n\n### Nobody is all right\n\nBeck arrived in Harrisburg in the ’70s, just a few years out of college, and began working to get homeless individuals into rehab.\n\nOne winter day, she found an inebriated man wrapped in a blanket under a bridge. He had soiled himself, and the urine had frozen his blanket to the sidewalk. As Beck and her colleagues tried to free the man from his frozen predicament, he started yelling, “Leave me alone. I’m all right.”\n\nBeck said she started laughing, the sound echoing under the bridge.\n\n“If that isn’t the human condition,” she recalled thinking. “We think we’re all right when we’re not. None of us are.”\n\nFor that man and many others Beck treated in those days, long-term stays in rehab facilities is what worked to get them sober. Even today, while medications are available to treat opioid use disorder on an outpatient basis, public health officials agree that long-term residential care is the best option for those addicted to certain drugs, like<a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/opioid-addiction/philadelphia-pennsylvania-meth-cocaine-stimulant-use-rising-20191001.html\" > methamphetamine and cocaine</a>.\n\nThat’s why Beck says it’s crucial to keep fighting for residential treatment, a battle she first began in 1980.\n\n### Learning the Capitol\n\nAlthough the patients in Beck’s rehab program were typically homeless, she learned that for the majority, addiction started while they were employed and living at home. They didn’t get treatment at that early stage, though, because insurers didn’t cover it.\n\nFrustrated by that fact, Beck took her complaints to newly-elected state Rep. Peter Wambach, a Democrat representing Dauphin County.\n\n“Debbie knew her subject and had a hell of a desire to do something,” Wambach recalled of that first meeting. “She just didn’t know how to do it.”\n\nThe two became an instant team. Beck educated Wambach on addiction as a disease and how it would save insurers money to treat it upfront. Wambach taught her the ins and outs of politics.\n\nFor the next six years, Wambach introduced a bill every session requiring insurers to cover treatment for alcoholism. And each year Beck visited lawmakers to advocate for the bill.\n\nMany days she waited in the hallways with a paper bag full of research studies only to be turned away. Some lawmakers mistook her for the Planned Parenthood lobbyist, she said, one of the only other women at the Capitol at that time.\n\nBeck was undeterred. She just had to adjust her approach.\n\nHer standard pitch at the time ended with the line: “Addiction is an always fatal illness if left unchecked.” If that’s the case, one lawmaker said, the problem will take care of itself. Horrified, Beck quickly pivoted.\n\n“Do you know how much it costs to kill one of these people?” she asked. It turned out focusing on dollars rather than emotion was sometimes more effective.\n\n### Trying to save lives\n\nBy 1986, Wambach, Beck, and a handful of other advocates finally built enough support to pass a law requiring all group health insurance plans to provide treatment for alcoholism.\n\nThree years later, the requirement was expanded to include all drug addiction treatment. And when insurers refused to comply, Beck was among the lead advocates who took the case to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, where <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/pa-supreme-court/1411638.html\" >the landmark legislation was upheld in 2009</a>.\n\n{{<picture src=\"2019/12/deb-beck3.jpeg\" caption=\"Deb Beck (center back) celebrates as Gov. Bob Casey Sr. (center front) signed Act 152 into law in 1988. The law required public insurance to cover drug and alcohol addiction treatment, an expansion of a previous law championed by Beck.\" description=\"Deb Beck (center back) celebrates as Gov. Bob Casey Sr. (center front) signed Act 152 into law in 1988. The law required public insurance to cover drug and alcohol addiction treatment, an expansion of a previous law championed by Beck.\" credit=\"Courtesy Peter Wambach\">}}\n\nBecause of those laws, an estimated 500,000 Pennsylvanians have received treatment, Wambach said.\n\nOver the years, Beck’s lobbying style has never changed, he said. She always prefers catching legislators in the hallway to say hi and offer help rather than sending a calendar invite. She talks fast, uses animated hand gestures and doesn’t hesitate to say what she thinks. She still sends research studies to support her points — but now they are PDFs rather than printouts in a paper bag.\n\nAnd she knows how to use the clout of the businesses she represents — including the number of people they employ in local legislative districts — to sway lawmakers.\n\nWhenever one was reluctant to support certain legislation she was backing, Wambach said, Beck would reach out to the treatment providers in their district, as well as residents in recovery.\n\n“All of a sudden before the vote, there were 10 calls in to that guy,” Wambach said.\n\nStill, Beck insists she’s \"a clinician, not a politician,” which is her oft-repeated refrain.\n\nThat’s why she finds it baffling that people think she has too much influence. If she had real power, Beck said, she would make sure insurers never deny addiction treatment and that people in addiction are sent to rehab more often than prison.\n\n“If anything we don’t have enough influence,” Beck said. “We’re trying to save lives.”\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

Now, five separate cases before the state Supreme Court are attacking it as outdated, discriminatory and unnecessarily cruel, depriving thousands of people of their fundamental rights.\n\nThe cases challenge nearly every aspect of the law, which has undergone several incarnations since being signed in 1995, one year after the death of 7-year-old Megan Kanka. The New Jersey girl was raped and killed by a neighbor who, unbeknownst to her family, was a twice-convicted pedophile. Similar laws were adopted across the U.S. and at the federal level.\n\nProsecutors believe the pending cases could gut Pennsylvania’s law, allowing sexually violent predators to evade detection and endangering public safety. They also warn that the law’s best-known aspect — the website that lists the thousands of offenders in the state — could be watered down or even dismantled. In the past year alone, the website received 411 million page views, state records show.\n\n\"Awareness and knowledge are power, and they are precisely why this offender registry exists and what is at stake in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,” said Attorney General Josh Shapiro, whose office is leading the defense of the law in some of the cases before the high court.\n\nDefense lawyers, joined by a growing chorus of experts in the criminal justice reform movement, dismiss that as false hysteria. They argue the cases expose deep constitutional problems and should, at a minimum, push the state legislature to rethink its approach to managing people who commit sexual violence.\n\n“The way the system works currently cannot continue to function,” said Aaron Marcus, an assistant defender attorney with the Defender Association of Philadelphia and one of the lawyers involved in challenging the law.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nAt the heart of the majority of cases is the latest iteration of the Sexual Offender Registration and Notification Act, or SORNA, which evolved out of the original Megan’s Law. When SORNA took effect at the end of 2012, it greatly expanded the law, increasing the list of offenses subject to registration and notification — including a handful that are not sexual in nature — and imposing more stringent registration and notification rules.\n\nThe state’s Megan’s Law registry more than doubled, growing from about 10,000 people to just over 20,000, according to the Pennsylvania State Police, which oversees the registry.\n\nMarcus said that after “decades of trial, mountains of empirical evidence and close to one million people around the country being denied their rights to liberty and their reputation,\" no hard evidence exists that the public is any safer or that assaults have been prevented.\n\nOne of the most closely-watched cases before the high court deals with requirements under the current law for people classified as “sexually-violent predators,\" those who have committed the most serious offenses and who are considered to have a high likelihood to reoffend. They are subject to lifetime registration, as well as lifetime counseling and community notification.\n\nThe case centers on whether those rigorous registration, notification and counseling requirements constitute unlawful punishment.\n\nBrought by a Butler County man who pleaded guilty to statutory sexual assault and corruption of minors, the case targets the state’s little-known process for assessing sexual offenders. A board of psychiatrists, psychologists and criminal justice professionals in Pennsylvania make recommendations to the court about whether someone should be classified as a sexually violent predator.\n\nSince 2000, the board has completed 20,260 assessments, according to state officials. In 6,027 of those cases, it has recommended that the offender be classified as a sexually violent predator, although the courts have not always agreed.\n\n“This is the case that will dictate how we operate going forward,” said Meghan Dade, the board’s executive director. “This is a pivotal moment in Pennsylvania.”\n\nAnother case before the court arose from the convoluted registration system for offenders. Because of a separate legal challenge, the law now imposes two different sets of rules: one for people who committed crimes prior to Dec. 20, 2012 — when the current law went into effect in Pennsylvania — and another for people who committed crimes after that date.\n\nLawyers for a Chester County man — a biochemical engineer with no prior record who was convicted in 2017 of aggravated indecent assault and subject to lifetime registration — are arguing the law violates a fundamental right to reputation under the state Constitution. It presumes that people convicted of certain sexual offenses cannot change and therefore are prone to reoffending, they contend.\n\nIn court papers, the lawyers, led by Marcus, cite experts and studies that show the public holds a false perception that people convicted of sexual offenses will go on to reoffend, and that their risk for doing so lasts for years. In fact, they said, only a small number of offenders fit that bill, while the rest get lumped into that group, suffering a lifetime of harm.\n\nTheir arguments go to the heart of the criminal justice reform movement blossoming across the country that aims to reduce harsh penalties for smaller offenses, and reform policies for offenders who, after serving prison time, suffer myriad social and financial hardships.\n\n“It is difficult to overstate the impact that sex offender registration has on a person’s life,” Marcus said.\n\nLawyers are paying close attention to the case because it takes aim at the state’s sex-offender website, which some view as aiding in destroying reputations because it is so widely accessible.\n\n“The long-term viability of the Megan’s Law website could be implicated,” said Carson Morris, a deputy attorney general in the state Attorney General’s office who is defending Megan’s Law in one of the five cases before the high court.\n\nTwo other cases also attempt to convince the justices that portions of the current law are unconstitutional. A fifth targets a related but separate statute regarding how juvenile sex offenders are treated. Specifically, the statute permits the civil commitment of a small group of people who engaged in sexually violent acts as juveniles and have aged out of the juvenile justice system.\n\nThe justices are expected to rule separately in each of the challenges. Collectively, their rulings could upend large swaths of the law and force the legislature to make changes.\n\nIn the Capitol, elected officials eyeing the outcome of the five current cases said they will work to keep the heart and soul of Megan’s Law intact.\n\nRep.

			"body": "\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\" target=_blank><i>Sign up for our free weekly newsletter</i></a><i>.</i>\n\nHARRISBURG — Late Monday evening, at the tail end of one of the busiest days of the year in the state Capitol, Gov. Wolf sent over a list of five names to be read aloud on the Senate floor. They were his picks to fill vacancies on several courts across the state, including a coveted spot on one of the appellate courts that hears cases against the government.\n\nOn its face, it appeared an unremarkable and unceremonious moment, one the public would barely, if ever, notice.\n\nIn fact, the nominations culminated weeks of political negotiations and horse-trading between legislative leaders and the governor that occurred behind closed doors, with scarce, if any, public input. By the time Wolf sent the names, the deal had been cut, the handshakes made, and a vote on them, expected in the next few weeks, will likely be ceremonial.\n\nThough not a new process, the lack of transparency or public checks in filling judicial vacancies is getting renewed scrutiny this year because of Wolf’s choice for the appellate seat: Drew Crompton, the top lawyer, adviser and strategist to the top Republican in the state Senate, with whom Wolf, a Democrat, must strike deals to advance his legislative platform.\n\nThe nomination comes during a week when the legislature is pushing through several high-profile bills, including one championed by Wolf to raise the minimum wage. If confirmed, Crompton would fill a vacancy on Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Court, the appellate court hearing lawsuits involving government agencies, laws and regulations.\n\nAsked what deals, if any, were made during the negotiating process, Wolf spokesman J.J. Abbott said the judicial package was “negotiated on its own.”\n\n{{<donate-inline>}}\n\n“Gov. Wolf believes filing vacancies to the court is important and has been seeking to fill as many as possible,” Abbott said. “This agreement will particularly help local courts in Philadelphia and Allegheny handle their significant caseloads.”\n\nIn Pennsylvania, judges are elected in partisan elections, although there have been efforts for years by legislators and advocacy groups to move to a merit-based system. When judges retire before their terms expire, the governor selects replacements, which the state Senate then must confirm by a two-thirds vote. That’s when politics can dominate.\n\nThe process unfolds almost entirely in secret, making it hard to determine if the most qualified applicants get the job.\n\nWolf’s office has declined to say how many people applied for the Commonwealth Court vacancy or the other openings in county courts across the state. Applicants were vetted by an advisory committee that answers to the governor, but it’s unclear who sits on it, which applicants it recommended or if it even made recommendations.\n\nA public records request filed last month by The Caucus, a partner newsroom of Spotlight PA, sought the applications for the appellate position, but the governor’s office denied releasing the information. The Caucus appealed, and on Wednesday, the Office of Open Records ruled that the administration needed to make them public, albeit with redactions for any personal information. Wolf can appeal, and his office said it is reviewing its options.\n\n“It amazes me that this is the process we’re using to choose judges,” said Sen. Katie Muth (D., Montgomery), who is in her first term in the Senate and has been one of the most vocal critics, particularly on social media, of what she views as deals benefiting the “well-connected and privileged.”\n\nSettling on candidates becomes a game of horse-trading between the governor and the top Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate, who can make or break a nomination. Names are swapped back and forth, with consideration given not just to nominees’ resumes, but also their political affiliation.\n\nFor example, a deal was being negotiated to appoint a Republican to a vacancy on the Court of Common Pleas in Delaware County, said Sen. Tim Kearney, a first-term Democrat who represents that area. Kearney said Republicans pushed for the choice in the face of historic losses to Democrats in county council and judicial elections this month, breaking a once-legendary GOP stronghold.\n\nKearney, a Democrat from Delaware County whose father served as a judge, said given those results he couldn’t “in good conscience” support the deal. The overall process, he said, also doesn’t “sit well” with him. Wolf did not end up nominating anyone for the Delaware County vacancy.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nAside from Crompton, the governor nominated Cateria McCabe, Dan Sulman and John Padova to fill vacancies on the court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia; and Bruce Beemer, a former state Attorney General and now a Wolf appointee running the Inspector General’s office, to fill a vacancy on the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County. There are vacancies in five other county courts of Common Pleas, including Dauphin and Lancaster counties.\n\nRepublican and Democratic legislative leaders either declined or did not respond to requests for comment on the nominating process.\n\nCrompton’s nomination has received the most attention. A graduate of Dickinson College and the Widener University School of Law, Crompton has been the lead lawyer and adviser to Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson), who decides everything from personnel matters to which bills reach the floor for a vote.\n\nIn that role, Crompton has served as both architect and author of key pieces of the GOP’s legislative agenda. In the building, he is sometimes referred to as the “51st senator” — a nod to the trust and power Scarnati has given him.\n\nHe has the reputation of being a smart and savvy strategist, and open to compromise in a building that often eschews concessions. Yet he also has fierce detractors who believe Scarnati’s office can be ruthless and run roughshod over people who oppose it.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday, Crompton said he understands that “if you work in this space for a long time, you are going to have critics.” But, he said, “I also believe I have a lot of respect from people I work with on both sides of the aisle and people in the outside world.”\n\nHe said the application process was extensive and included dozens of pages of paperwork and a rigorous interview by members of Wolf’s advisory commission.\n\nCrompton said he believes his background in helping craft legislation on issues ranging from taxes to pensions to environmental laws makes him uniquely qualified for the court. The unexpired term Crompton would fill ends in 2021, at which point he would decide whether to run for a full, 10-year term. He would earn an annual salary of $199,114.\n\nHe dismissed criticism that his background is too partisan or that his appointment is somehow uniquely political. Indeed, Wolf has appointed lawyers who have worked for his administration to judicial posts.\n\n“I am not going to hedge that I have worked for the Senate GOP for a long period of time,\" said Crompton, \"but if I am confirmed, I will make a full break with the Senate.”\n\n“People change careers,” he added. “They leave one segment of their life behind and start another.”\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

As part of the agreement, HACC will pay for students to receive up to three sessions per semester, but it will not provide space on any of its five campuses for students to meet the counselors.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nMazzitti &amp; Sullivan, which already provides mental health services for HACC employees, has three offices in the Harrisburg area, but none near HACC’s other campuses in Lancaster, Lebanon, Gettysburg, and York. The closest is 30 minutes away.\n\nThe college’s announcement comes after a series of reports by Spotlight PA documented how <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/11/hacc-community-college-campus-mental-health-suicide/\">students have been struggling to get care</a> since the college stopped group and individual mental health counseling in September. HACC <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/10/pa.s-largest-community-college-eliminates-campus-mental-health-counseling-for-17k-students/\" target=\"_blank\">made the change without notifying students</a> and before it had finalized arrangements for an alternate counseling provider.\n\nCollege health experts said eliminating on-campus counseling is risky given the persistent rise in the number of students experiencing depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Suicide is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/images/lc-charts/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2017_1100w850h.jpg\">second-leading cause of death</a> for that age group, and the demand for campus counseling services has <a href=\"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800332\">nearly doubled over the past decade</a>. They said referring students off campus adds another barrier to getting help, and many don’t follow through due to challenges with time, transportation, and insurance.\n\nHACC President John Sygielski has offered several explanations for cutting campus mental health services, from a $2.7 million budget deficit to a lack of students using counseling and increased demand for virtual services or more flexible office hours.\n\nIn a Nov. 4 interview, Sygielski conceded the college hadn’t actually saved any money from cutting campus mental health counseling because the advisers who provided it will be employed through October 2020 to continue offering academic and career counseling. Their positions will then be eliminated.\n\nHACC agreed to pay Mazzitti & Sullivan a $15,000 annual retainer, which will cover the resources to support the program. HACC will also pay $110 per counseling session, per student. Students do not need health insurance to participate.\n\n“The college will assess the arrangement after six months and make adjustments if needed to ensure that student needs are being met,” HACC said.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

She was taking college courses for the first time and juggling care for three children, two of whom have autism.\n\nLife was starting to feel out of control, Beachtel, 33, said in a recent interview. She had dealt with mental illness since she was a kid, and she knew she needed to talk to someone. Late that month, she said, she walked into the counseling office on the college’s Gettysburg campus and asked for help.\n\n“I’m really overwhelmed, I’m feeling suicidal, and just really need to talk to somebody,” she recalled telling the woman at the front desk.\n\nBeachtel didn’t know it at the time, but just a few weeks earlier, HACC — Pennsylvania’s largest community college — had instructed counselors to stop providing mental health services. The change, which was not publicly announced to students, was <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/10/pa.s-largest-community-college-eliminates-campus-mental-health-counseling-for-17k-students/\" target=\"_blank\">first reported by Spotlight PA</a>.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nBeachtel was told that no one was available and that she would have to find a therapist in the community.\n\n“I was devastated,” she said. “I should have been able to speak to somebody, at least anybody who could have directed me so I didn’t have to go home and feel like that.”\n\nMore than a month after the college eliminated mental health counseling across its five campuses, there is still confusion about how students can access care. And a Spotlight PA review of the list of resources being given to students found outdated phone numbers and providers with long wait times.\n\nThere are also new questions about the timing of the college’s decision to eliminate the services. President John Sygielski has offered several explanations for the cut, from a $2.7 million budget deficit to a lack of students using counseling and increased demand for virtual services or more flexible office hours.\n\n### RELATED STORIES\n\n- __[Pa.’s largest community college eliminates campus mental health counseling for 17K students](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/10/pa.s-largest-community-college-eliminates-campus-mental-health-counseling-for-17k-students/)__\n- __[Students blast Pa.'s largest community college for cutting campus mental health services](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2019/10/hacc-community-college-mental-health-counseling-cut-funding/)__\n\nIn a Nov. 4 interview, Sygielski conceded the college hadn’t actually saved any money from cutting campus mental health counseling because the advisers who provided it will be employed through October 2020 to continue offering academic and career counseling. Their positions will then be eliminated.\n\nThe college has yet to finalize any agreements with external providers to offer students low- or no-cost counseling, which is important for those who have limited or no insurance. Asked why services were cut before an agreement was in place, Sygielski said he wanted students to go directly to community providers rather than see an on-campus counselor and then, after a few sessions, be referred off campus.\n\n“What we want to do is make sure we refer students from the get-go, so there’s no transition,” he said.\n\nIn a <a href=\"http://newsroom.hacc.edu/article_display.cfm?article_id=2918\" target=_blank>previous statement on Oct. 25</a>, however, HACC said those situations rarely occurred: \"Most clinical mental health counseling needs were handled internally and resolved within one or two visits.”\n\nRegardless, students in crisis shouldn’t be told to wait, Beachtel said.\n\n“I don’t want them to feel like I felt,” she said. “I wouldn’t wish that on anybody.”\n\n{{<picture src=\"2019/11/hacc-jennifer-beachtel.jpeg\" caption=\"Jennifer Beachtel, 33, a student at the Gettysburg campus of HACC, Central Pennsylvania's Community College, said she was feeling suicidal in September and went to the college's counseling office, but was turned away.\" description=\"Jennifer Beachtel, 33, a student at the Gettysburg campus of HACC, Central Pennsylvania's Community College, said she was feeling suicidal in September and went to the college's counseling office, but was turned away.\" credit=\"Courtesy Jennifer Beachtel\">}}\n\nWhat saved Beachtel was her 17-year-old daughter’s encouragement to call a crisis line, she said. The person who answered helped calm her down.\n\n“If I didn’t have that, I wouldn’t be talking to you right now,” she said.\n\nBeachtel later called a therapy provider to schedule an appointment and was told she would have to wait three weeks to see a counselor. She continued to call the crisis line in the weeks before her appointment.\n\nHACC declined to comment on Beachtel’s case, but said that the protocol for students who are suicidal is to call campus security and get them help immediately.\n\n“The system that was implemented in September 2019 is working well,” the college said in a <a href=\"http://newsroom.hacc.edu/article_display.cfm?article_id=2920\" target=_blank>statement</a>. “While HACC no longer provides clinical mental health counseling, making sure students are still handled with compassion and care is at the core of the college’s decision-making.”\n\nCollege mental health experts said eliminating on-campus counseling is risky given the persistent rise in the number of students experiencing depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Suicide is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/images/lc-charts/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2017_1100w850h.jpg\" target=_blank>second-leading cause of death</a> for that age group, and the demand for campus counseling services has <a href=\"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800332\" target=_blank>nearly doubled over the past decade</a>.\n\nAs part of the change, HACC said students who seek mental health services will be referred to deans of student affairs, who will then refer them to off-campus providers. The deans use a list of 24 community resources across the college’s campuses in Harrisburg, York, Lancaster, Gettysburg, and Lebanon.\n\nSygielski said they either hand students the list of phone numbers with suggestions of particular providers to call first, or in crisis situations make the calls themselves. The college said the list is updated annually. But a review by Spotlight PA found outdated numbers and providers too full to accommodate new clients.\n\nThe number listed for True North Wellness in York actually rang the First National Bank in Palmyra. A listing for Northwest Human Services in Lebanon did not go to a counseling office, but to an administrative center in Hummelstown for Merakey, the name the company has gone by since April 2018.\n\nHACC has since updated both resources after being contacted by Spotlight PA.\n\nEight of the contacts on the college’s referral list were crisis intervention lines, used for people who are at risk of harming themselves or others but typically not for scheduling counseling sessions. Another eight were referral providers, meaning they would give students another list of phone numbers to call to get counseling services.\n\nThe remaining eight resources provide actual clinical services such as in-person counseling. Some are specialized, such as YWCA Lancaster, which offers only sexual abuse and trauma counseling, or Pathways Center for Grief and Loss, which offers only bereavement counseling.\n\nMost of the providers said it would take one to two weeks for a student to get an appointment. One said it was booking appointments into December. Only Catholic Charities and WellSpan Philhaven, each with locations across Central Pennsylvania, said they could see a student with any mental health concern within two days.\n\nCollege health experts said a referral system is most successful when schools regularly update provider contact information and confirm they’re able to take new clients. Some colleges pay services like Thriving Campus to help coordinate the referral process, while others hire case managers to assist students.\n\n“You want to have as few impediments or hurdles in the system as you possibly can,” said Victor Schwartz, a licensed psychiatrist and chief medical officer of the JED Foundation, which works to prevent youth suicide. “You don’t want to send someone to a clinician that says, ‘I can see you in eight weeks,’ because that’s two-thirds of a semester.”\n\nLong wait times for counseling are common across the country. The demand for mental health services has increased and there often is a shortage of providers. The strain is especially prominent at low- or no-cost centers for people who can’t afford therapy, such as some community college students.\n\nA 2016 report found that <a href=\"https://hope4college.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Wisconsin_HOPE_Lab-Too_Distressed_To_Learn.pdf\" target=_blank>13.5% of community college students nationally were uninsured</a>. Out-of-pocket costs for therapy often run upward of $80 per hour.\n\nIn some cases, taxpayer-funded county programs may pick up the slack after HACC’s cuts, covering the cost of care for those who can’t afford it.\n\nDan Eisenhauer, administrator for Dauphin County’s mental health, autism, and developmental programs, said he heard about HACC’s decision to eliminate campus mental health services through the media. His team then reached out to the college to see how it could help students find community providers.\n\n“This is perhaps a new population for us to serve,” Eisenhauer said, “but we’ll try to expedite it and get people connected so they can be successful at HACC.”\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\" data-analytics-label=\"hacc-resources\" id=\"hacc-resources__graphic\" data-iframe-fallback=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/hacc-resources/fallback-mobile.jpg\" data-iframe-fallback-width=\"350\" data-iframe-fallback-height=\"975\" data-iframe=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/hacc-resources/index.html\" data-iframe-height=\"975\" data-iframe-resizable></div>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">(function() { var l = function() { new pym.Parent( 'hacc-resources__graphic', 'https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/hacc-resources/index.html'); }; if(typeof(pym) === 'undefined') { var h = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0], s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.src = 'https://pym.nprapps.org/pym.v1.min.js'; s.onload = l; h.appendChild(s); } else { l(); } })(); </script>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

She has no car, and on class days, she takes two buses and walks a mile to get to the Harrisburg campus from her Penbrook home. Over the past year, the college counselors have come to know her, listening to her vent and helping her problem-solve.\n\nSo when Herb learned the college had eliminated its campus mental health services, she was outraged.\n\n“Are they serious?’” Herb said in an interview at a campus sit-in organized by students protesting cuts. “There is no benefit to taking away mental health services.\"\n\n“I'm going to let them know I'm standing my ground to say these services need to be here.\"\n\nIn September, HACC — with campuses in Harrisburg, York, Lancaster, Lebanon and Gettysburg — told counselors to stop individual and group counseling.

Many are calling for services to be reinstated immediately.\n\n\"They should bring them back,” said Will Trinh, a 20-year-old student at the Harrisburg campus. “These services are essential to the wellbeing of students and if HACC isn't providing that, then the school isn't doing its job to care for students.\"\n\nThe president of the college, John Sygielski, said eliminating campus mental health counseling was part of a larger reorganization to address a $2.7 million budget deficit. He also said there had been an increase in demand for virtual services and flexible appointment times outside typical office hours.\n\n“While the College needs to be fiscally responsible and modify or eliminate certain services, it is doing so with students’ academic success and well-being at the forefront,” the college <a href=\"http://newsroom.hacc.edu/article_display.cfm?article_id=2917\" >said in an Oct. 23 statement</a>.\n\nBut students say the college isn’t putting them first.\n\n<i><b>» SEND A TIP: We want to hear from college students, professors and parents about </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/tips\"><i><b>how campus mental health services are — or are not — working</b></i></a><i><b>, including the availability of counseling services, voluntary/involuntary leaves of absence and any policies that treat students with mental illness differently.</b></i>\n\nKelsey Thomas, a 22-year-old student at the Harrisburg campus, said she was so angry when she heard the news that she cried. She said the college isn’t “listening to those who are asking for help.”\n\n“Where’s your money going?” Thomas asked of the college. “Because there are people who don’t have insurance who really rely on these services for help.”\n\nIn recent years, HACC has purchased new buildings and renovated old ones at several of its campuses. In 2017, it completed a $12 million renovation of the Cooper Student Center in Harrisburg.\n\nAlthough the student center project is being paid through fundraising, the other renovations are included in HACC’s operating budget. Since 2016, the college’s debt service has grown by 38%, according to <a href=\"https://www.hacc.edu/AboutHACC/CollegeFactSheet/index.cfm\" >budget documents posted to its website</a>.\n\nThe mental health counseling services previously offered on campus were free. Thomas said she’s uninsured and suffers from severe anxiety, and though she had yet to make use of the service, she always felt more comfortable knowing someone was there in case she faced a crisis.\n\nA 2016 report found that nationally, <a href=\"https://hope4college.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Wisconsin_HOPE_Lab-Too_Distressed_To_Learn.pdf\" >13.5% of community college students are uninsured</a>. Out-of-pocket costs for therapy often run upwards of $80 per hour. Even with insurance, copays can start at $20.\n\nSygielski said the college is in discussions with a third party to provide clinical services at low or no cost.\n\nCollege mental health experts said eliminating on-campus counseling is risky given the persistent rise in the number of students experiencing depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Suicide is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/injury/images/lc-charts/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2017_1100w850h.jpg\" >second-leading cause of death</a> for that age group, and the demand for campus counseling services has <a href=\"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800332\" >nearly doubled over the past decade</a>.\n\nElizabeth Bolden, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Commission for Community Colleges, said colleges would like to be doing more, “but they simply can’t.”\n\nState funding for Pennsylvania's 14 public community colleges was cut by 10% in 2011. Since then, year-to-year funding has either stayed flat or increased only slightly. At the same time, enrollment at colleges nationwide has fallen, leaving many universities with large budget deficits.\n\nIn 2014, HACC served about 20,000 students. This year, that number is 17,400.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nPublic community colleges in Pennsylvania eliminated 2,724 employee positions from 2013 through 2018, Bolden said, and some have outsourced their bookstores and food services. HACC’s decision is just the latest example of trimming services, she said.\n\nThree of Pennsylvania’s other public community college systems also refer students off campus for mental health counseling. Two of them are significantly smaller than HACC, but the Community College of Allegheny County is comparable, serving more than 15,000 students across four campuses.\n\nThe remaining 10 public community colleges offer on-campus mental health services, with the number of full-time counselors ranging from one at Pennsylvania Highlands Community College to 20 at the Community College of Philadelphia.\n\nEliminating campus mental health services runs counter to the findings of a <a href=\"https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/20180827-Gov-Office-School-Safety-Report-2018.pdf\" >2018 school safety report</a> released by Auditor General Eugene DePasquale and Gov. Tom Wolf, which called for an increase in access to mental health services within the state’s K-12 schools.\n\nCollege students are likely facing similar concerns, DePasquale said in an interview.\n\n“It’s important they don’t have to jump through hoops to get services,” he said.\n\nFor now, HACC students are trying to fill the gap themselves. In a Facebook group, one student offered her services as a certified peer support specialist and others discussed when therapy dogs would be visiting campus.\n\nJennifer Beachtel, a 33-year-old student at the Gettysburg campus, is trying to start a mental health awareness club. She knows it can’t replace counseling services, but hopes it will help.\n\n“I can’t fix the problem,” she said. “I can only provide peer assistance and advocacy.”\n",

For instance, the measure would require candidates to submit credit-card statements with their regularly filed campaign finance reports and ban the use of gift cards that can be used to further shield expenses.\n\nIt would also further define and prohibit a candidate’s “personal use” of campaign funds, and it would give the Pennsylvania Department of State more oversight in responding to public requests for campaign records.\n\n“Recent media reports have also shown that the use of credit cards and gift cards have provided campaign committees with a method to obscure from public view how political action committee money is being used,” said Costa, a Pittsburgh Democrat who has unsuccessfully pushed similar measures for nearly a decade. “In many cases, the expenses may be crossing the line into personal use, but because it’s difficult or impossible to see what the expense are, there is no accountability.”\n\nCosta’s bill was unveiled in the wake of an investigation published this week by The Caucus and Spotlight PA that found lawmakers<a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/spl/pa-election-campaign-spending-hidden-expenses-spotlight-pa-20191022.html\" target=\"_blank\"> have used credit cards, gift cards, and self-reimbursements to shield almost $3.5 million </a>in campaign spending in recent years.\n\nThose expenses included foreign trips, country club memberships, lavish dinners, alcohol, and even a DNA test kit. They were not disclosed in public reports and were brought to light only after reporters used a little-known provision of state election law that requires campaigns to keep “vouchers,” or receipts, for the past three years and make them available upon request.\n\nLegislative leaders had some of the most obscured spending during the years reviewed, with Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R. Jefferson) topping that list. Costa also came in near the top — using his credit card to spend almost $15,000 on partial season ticket packages to Pittsburgh Penguins games, which he said were for supporters, and 125 Pittsburgh Penguins hats for $3,125, which he said were a “measure of appreciation and good will” for Senators and staff.\n\nHis reform proposal would need to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate, whose top leadership this week first <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/spl/pennsylvania-elections-campaign-finance-less-oversight-campaign-expenses-20191022.html\" target=_blank>pushed to reduce oversight of campaign spending and reporting</a> — before <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/spl/pennsylvania-election-campaign-expenses-spotlight-pa-20191023.html\" target=_blank>abruptly reversing course</a> a day later.\n\nIn a tweet Friday, Scarnati wrote: “I stand with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Senatorcosta\">@Senatorcosta</a>’s goal of strengthening the current law to improve transparency for campaign disclosure in PA.”\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As stated in the campaign expenditure stories released this week, all campaign laws have been followed. That said, I stand with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Senatorcosta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Senatorcosta</a>’s goal of strengthening the current law to improve transparency for campaign disclosure in PA. <a href=\"https://t.co/Wk2VIBZmIa\">https://t.co/Wk2VIBZmIa</a></p>&mdash; Senator Joe Scarnati (@senatorscarnati) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/senatorscarnati/status/1187763900701466626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 25, 2019</a></blockquote>\n\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\nBoth the previous and new versions of his bill would define “personal use” to include home mortgages and rent, clothing, non-campaign vehicle expenses, country club memberships, admission to sporting events, vacations and non-campaign related trips and more.\n\nThe bill would also limit individual donations to  $1,500 for candidates for the General Assembly, Common Pleas courts, and county or local offices. Individual donations to statewide candidates would be capped at $5,000; political action committees would be limited to $10,000 per candidate.\n\nPennsylvania is the only state that neither explicitly prohibits candidates from spending campaign cash for personal use nor limits contributions to campaigns, according to a nationwide survey by The Caucus and Spotlight PA.\n",

The news organizations then requested additional information from the campaigns with the most dark spending. Here are 10 of the more notable expenses:\n\n## Trip through Europe\n\nAt least $15,300 spent on stops including London, Brussels, Austria and Munich by three Senate campaigns in 2016. The sojourning senators — Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson), Chuck McIlhinney (R., Bucks) and Rich Alloway (R., Franklin) — ended their trip in Germany during Oktoberfest. Read more about <a href=\"/news/2019/10/mystery-trip-to-europe-with-donors-by-pa-state-senators/\">the trip and the mysterious circumstances surrounding it.</a>\n\n\n## ‘Rich’s birthday’\n\nOpen bar and hors d’oeuvres for purchased for $3,797 by Alloway’s campaign for the former senator’s birthday. The event was for 80 people at the Orchards, a restaurant in Chambersburg in his district. The menu included crab balls, meatballs, veggies, a fruit and cheese display, tiropita, spanakopita, scallops with bacon, buffalo shrimp and a $50 birthday cake.\n\n## Pittsburgh Penguins hats\n\n125 hats purchased for $3,125 by Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny) over back-to-back Stanley Cup years in 2016 and 2017. Costa’s campaign said the Penguins had just won the Stanley Cup and gifting the team hats to senators and staff was a “measure of appreciation and good will.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\n## Walking shoes\n\nTwo pairs purchased for $223 by Rep. Chris Sainato (D., Mercer) in November 2018 for walking “door to door” in the next election. “You go through them in a year,” Sainato said, claiming the shoes were a legitimate campaign expense.\n\n## Senate chamber photo\n\nPurchased with a gold-plated frame for $193, a parting gift for former Scarnati aide Casey Long. He left for the Long Nyquist lobbying firm founded by his father, Mike Long, and later Todd Nyquist, another former top Senate GOP aide.\n\n## Ralph Lauren shirt\n\nPurchased for $146 by McIlhinney’s campaign. He said he bought the shirt in fall 2017 to wear at that year’s Pennsylvania Society annual wine-and-dine gala in New York City in December.\n\n## DNA test kit\n\nPurchased for $109 in April 2016 by McIlhinney. He said he sought ancestry verification following a Senate debate “in which I made statements concerning my forefathers.” He didn’t elaborate. One month before he purchased the DNA kit, McIlhinney co-sponsored a Senate resolution designating March 2016 as “Irish American Heritage month.” In separate written responses to the Caucus and Spotlight PA on another issue, McIlhinney referred to ”my Irish heritage.”\n\n## Ugly sweater contest\n\nGift card prizes purchased for $75 by Scarnati’s campaign in December 2015. Lawrence Tabas, a lawyer for Scarnati’s campaign, said the event used campaign money for the prizes to thank Scarnati staff members who work with the campaign while off the clock.\n\n## Queen’s cape\n\nPurchased for $30 by former Rep. Dom Costa (D., Allegheny) to adorn a plastic skeleton in a cardboard coffin displayed at Costa’s Halloween fund-raising party, according to his wife, Darlene, the campaign treasurer. “She \\[the skeleton\\] was Queen for a Day,” Darlene Costa said, referring to a TV show in the 1950s and `60s. The Costas went all-out at their Halloween gigs, she said, and they were a significant fund-raising tool for the campaign.\n\n## Ultraviolet black-light detector\n\nFor “Dog Urine, Pet Stains, and Bed Bug,” purchased for $10 by Scarnati’s campaign. One of a number of gifts purchased for a Senate “Bring Your Child to Work Day” in 2018.\n\n",

Other times, the expenses were listed as catering for unspecified events, or had no explanation. None of the receipts was itemized.\n\nBrown declined a request for an interview, but said in response to emailed questions that she does not use the card to campaign for Scarnati. Instead, she said, she is authorized to use it for spreading political goodwill, including buying colleagues a meal.\n\n“The election prospects of a senator often depend upon the senator’s success as a legislator, which is in part a function of the effective work of the senator’s staff,” she wrote.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nBarry Kauffman, who led Common Cause Pennsylvania for decades before retiring in 2016, said the political goodwill argument “generally doesn’t cut the mustard.”\n\n“If it’s just having drinks and dinners with friends, maybe that should come out of your own wallet,” said Kauffman, who lobbied lawmakers for years to toughen campaign finance laws, including asking candidates to be more specific when disclosing expenses.\n\nBrown’s purchases were uncovered as part of a year-long investigation by the Caucus and Spotlight PA into how many of the state’s most powerful lawmakers obscure the details of their campaign expenses in public disclosure forms.\n\nAs part of the investigation, the news organizations requested statements and receipts from Scarnati’s campaign and those of other top lawmakers from 2016 through 2018. In some cases, the expenditures were publicly listed with broad descriptions such as “credit card,” “meals,” or “campaign expenses,” and a total amount, with no other details.\n\n<b>» </b><i><b>DONATE NOW and </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate/\"><i><b>support future investigations by Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i><b> that hold the powerful in Pennsylvania to account. </b></i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate/\"><i><b>Become a Founding Donor </b></i></a><i><b>and support our investigative journalists.</b></i>\n\nIn the case of Brown, public disclosure forms do not detail her expenses or make it known that she’s the one spending the money.\n\nFor instance, voters would never know that on Jan. 22, 2016, she swiped her card at 1:07 p.m. at Mangia Qui, a restaurant across from the Capitol, picking up the $426 tab, records show. At 4:18 p.m., she charged an additional $144 at the Firehouse, a restaurant a few blocks away that has since closed. About an hour later, she again used the card to pay a $34 bar bill.\n\nAnother staff luncheon, on April 14, 2016, began at Lancaster Brewing Co., where Brown paid $313 at 2:26 p.m., and later migrated to Arooga’s, a sports bar a block from the Capitol in downtown Harrisburg, where she spent $49 just after 4 p.m. The guests at the lunch were not specified in receipts provided by the campaign.\n\nAnd in November of that year, Brown dropped $854 dining at restaurants around Harrisburg, including one outing described as an “Escape Room lunch” for her and senior staff at a restaurant along the main drag in Hershey. Those expenses came in the days after the hotly-contested presidential election.\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\" data-analytics-label=\"splcredit-shelly-brown3\" id=\"splcredit-shelly-brown3__graphic\" data-iframe-fallback=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/splcredit-shelly-brown3/fallback-mobile.jpg\" data-iframe-fallback-width=\"350\" data-iframe-fallback-height=\"539\" data-iframe=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/splcredit-shelly-brown3/index.html\" data-iframe-height=\"539\" data-iframe-resizable></div>\n\nScarnati’s campaign was the only one among the dozens of campaigns contacted as part of the investigation that had issued campaign credit cards to government staffers.\n\nLawrence Tabas, a lawyer for the campaign, said in a written response that some of Scarnati’s taxpayer-funded staff help with campaign activities. When they do, he said, it’s strictly on a volunteer basis and on their own, personal time.\n\nTabas also said Scarnati’s campaign “pays for any reasonable expense that has multiple purposes, which include the purpose to influence the outcome of an election.”\n\n“The matters discussed at these lunches cover a wide variety of topics, including political and election matters,” he said of Brown’s outings.\n\n<i><b>» READ MORE: </b></i><a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/spl/pennsylvania-elections-campaign-finance-less-oversight-campaign-expenses-20191022.html\" target=_blank><i><b>Hours after investigation reveals millions in hidden campaign spending, Pa. lawmakers push for less oversight</b></i></a>\n\nState workers are not prohibited from campaigning, but they must do so on their own time. That rule was at the center of a scandal a decade ago nicknamed “Bonusgate,” in which taxpayer-funded legislative employees who worked on campaigns were given generous bonuses, also paid for by taxpayers.\n\nThe scandal spawned a series of high-profile prosecutions that ended with a half-dozen lawmakers in prison, including two former House speakers.\n\nThough it did not move the legislature to enact sweeping reforms, the scandals did heighten awareness of the perils of mixing governing and campaigning. Kauffman said keeping government and campaign staffs distinctly separate is a good idea.\n\n“I think the public should have some assurance that regardless of politics, public officials — including their employees — will always be making decisions on behalf of taxpayers and voters,” he said.\n\n\n<div id=\"310290d7-98f6-45bd-85fa-fbc41c167e3e\"></div>\n",

Campaigns could also deny requestors access if they make multiple requests for the same records and “the repeated requests have placed an unreasonable burden,” according to language inserted into the bill.\n\nWhat constitutes an unreasonable burden? That will be up to the campaigns.\n\nRep. Garth Everett (R., Lycoming) — chairman of the House State Government Committee, which approved the measure Tuesday — said in an interview that Senate leadership requested the change to the bill. He said Republican leadership in both chambers and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf negotiated the language.\n\nIn a statement, the governor’s office said it believes the new language both clarifies the process for obtaining campaign expense records and strengthens the public’s ability to access them. The bill could come up for a full vote in both chambers of the Legislature this month.\n\nThe head of the Republican-controlled Senate, Joe Scarnati, led all lawmakers in the total amount of obscured spending from 2016 through 2018, according to the investigation by The Caucus and Spotlight PA. Scarnati’s chief of staff, Drew Crompton, declined to say if Scarnati requested or supported the new language.\n\n“This language had several authors,” Crompton said. “The primary author wasn’t Sen. Scarnati.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nScarnati’s campaign took six months to provide records requested as part of the investigation, far more than the 30 days it’s supposed to take under current law. Also, the campaign attempted to charge the news organizations more than $1,800 to reimburse the campaign’s accountant for the time she spent assembling the records.\n\nThe campaign agreed to provide them without the preparation charge only after a lawyer working on behalf of The Caucus intervened with the Department of State.\n\nPennsylvania lawmakers already have wide latitude in how they spend their campaign cash and disclose that spending to the public. The state is the only one with neither campaign contribution limits nor an explicit ban on spending campaign cash for personal use, according to a nationwide survey by The Caucus and Spotlight PA.\n\nLouisiana explicitly forbids candidates from reporting only that their campaign money was paid to a credit card company or to themselves as reimbursement. The same is true in Connecticut, where candidates must disclose the ultimate recipient of campaign money rather than bundling expenses into a single payment.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission, which oversees candidates for federal office, mandates itemized credit card expenses to prevent campaigns from obscuring spending.\n\nLarry Otter, a Bucks County lawyer who specializes in election law, said Pennsylvania should require campaigns to detail expenses.\n\n“They’ve certainly made the records more secretive and that is not a good thing,” Otter said.\n\nHe added, “I mean, how hard is this?”\n\n<div id=\"310290d7-98f6-45bd-85fa-fbc41c167e3e\"></div>\n",

So reporters for The Caucus and [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) asked for the receipts.\n\nThe effort began in July 2018, when reporters noticed thousands of dollars’ worth of Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati’s campaign credit card expenses listed as meals, travel, lodging, supplies or gifts with little detail on how that money was spent.\n\n**» _DONATE NOW_** _and_ [_support future investigations by Spotlight PA_](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate/) _that hold the powerful in Pennsylvania to account._ [_Become a Founding Donor now_](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate/) _and support our team of investigative journalists._\n\nThe reporters requested to review receipts for the expenses through the Department of State, which oversees campaigns. The department then made the request to the campaign, which is supposed to provide access within 30 days. It took six months to get the records.\n\nReporters sought to contextualize Scarnati’s obscured credit card spending by comparing it to other legislative campaigns. Using a database built by The Caucus, they identified nearly 300 other campaigns that obscured spending from 2016 through 2018, and then sought records for the 25 campaigns with the greatest totals. Those requests resulted in roughly 3,600 pages of documents, including receipts and credit card statements turned over by the campaigns.\n\nA few campaigns responded almost immediately and provided records, while others took months. Still other campaigns provided only a few records. Although campaigns are required to keep receipts, there’s no penalty if they don’t do it.\n\nWritten questions were sent to about two dozen campaigns that had the most obscured spending. About half responded, and of those, some ignored the specific questions from reporters and instead sent short statements.\n",

Inside, the chefs serve up pumpkin dumplings with wild broccoli, venison with king oyster mushroom and beef tartare with fig and summer truffle.\n\nThe restaurant touts itself as the oldest in Europe and is said to have been visited by Christopher Columbus and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. On a warm, late September day in 2016, the chefs served another dignitary of sorts: Joe Scarnati, the most powerful lawmaker in the Pennsylvania Senate.\n\nScarnati was 43 days from re-election and 4,300 miles from his constituents in his rural district along Pennsylvania’s northern tier. But records show the $246 bill was charged to his campaign credit card. So were other stops on his European trip, including in Germany, where he dropped $1,295 on lodging, and in Belgium, where he spent $152 at an Italian restaurant near Bruges’ historic city center.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania election law, campaign accounts must be used for “influencing the outcome of an election.” But what qualifies is largely open to interpretation. For Scarnati, a Jefferson County Republican with enormous influence over how tax dollars are spent, it’s the kind of dining on someone else’s dime that might have given voters pause — had they known about it.\n\nA year-long investigation by The Caucus and [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) found lawmakers across the state are shielding sometimes lavish campaign spending by not reporting the details to the public, making it extremely difficult for voters and donors to assess how the money was spent and if that spending was appropriate.\n\nFrom 2016 through 2018, state House and Senate candidates spent nearly $3.5 million that cannot be fully traced based on the information they publicly disclosed, according to thousands of pages of records obtained by the news organizations. Charges included foreign trips, sports tickets, limos, lavish dinners, fine wines and liquor, country club memberships and a DNA test kit.\n\nIn many cases, the expenditures were listed on publicly available campaign finance documents with entries such as “credit card,” “meals” or “travel,” and a total amount, with no other details. In other cases, expenses were listed in reports simply as a “reimbursement.”\n\n“It seems to me that when somebody digs deep into their pockets to contribute to a political campaign, my guess is that they want it to be for policy as opposed to ensure that someone gets beers and brats in Germany,” said Terry Mutchler, a First Amendment lawyer and former director of the state Office of Open Records. “A 12th grader can figure out that there is a problem here and that it leaves room for gaming the system.”\n\nPennsylvania lawmakers operate under some of the country’s weakest campaign finance laws. The state is the only one with neither contribution limits nor an explicit ban on spending campaign cash for personal use, according to a nationwide survey by The Caucus and [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/).\n\n<div id=\"container-vis-map-tile-usa-campaign-finance1\"></div>\n\nOver the years, Pennsylvania state lawmakers have dismissed efforts to impose more restrictions, arguing they are unnecessary as long as details about where the money comes from, and how it is spent, are available to the public.\n\nBut the investigation by The Caucus and [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) found  lawmakers are falling well short of their end of the bargain.\n\n**» _DONATE NOW_** _and_ [_support future investigations by Spotlight PA_](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate/) _that hold the powerful in Pennsylvania to account._ [_Become a Founding Donor now_](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate/) _and support our team of investigative journalists._\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Turzai, R., Allegheny, used a credit card to buy more than $3,500 in gift cards, for which no other documentation was available.\n\nThe campaign of Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D., Allegheny, spent nearly $15,000 on partial season ticket packages to Pittsburgh Penguins games over three years, which his campaign said he gave away as gifts. His public disclosure forms listed them as “expense reimbursement - event items,” “expense reimbursement - event prizes, etc.,” and “expense reimbursement - misc./labor lunch/breakfast mtg & event items.”\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\" data-analytics-label=\"splcredit-jaycosta1\" id=\"splcredit-jaycosta1__graphic\" data-iframe-fallback=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/splcredit-jaycosta1/fallback-mobile.jpg\" data-iframe-fallback-width=\"350\" data-iframe-fallback-height=\"1078.72966047405\" data-iframe=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/splcredit-jaycosta1/index.html\" data-iframe-height=\"1078.72966047405\" data-iframe-resizable></div>\n\nFormer Sen. Chuck McIlhinney, R., Bucks, used campaign money to pay for country club memberships, wine from California vineyards, a $145 Ralph Lauren shirt and the $109 DNA test kit, records show. Those were among a litany of purchases reported simply as “campaign expenses,” “storage,” “phones,” “fundraiser,” and other vague descriptions.\n\nAsked about the lack of detail in their reports, some legislators vowed to be more transparent, while others denied there was a problem.\n\nScarnati’s campaign obscured the most spending during the period reviewed. Lawrence Tabas, a prominent Republican lawyer who responded on Scarnati’s behalf, said all of the expenses were related to campaigning and descriptions of them on public forms were “adequate.”\n\nScarnati’s “committee has complied fully with both the spirit and the letter of the law,” said Tabas, who in July was elected chairman of the state Republican Party. Tabas also provided letters from auditors stating the campaign complied with “certain provisions” of the law, though it’s unclear what provisions they were citing.\n\nThe campaign manager for Turzai, Mike Barley, said he did not have records showing how the gift cards were spent, but he said most were for gas and pizza for campaign volunteers. Turzai said in a statement his expenses were legal and “our campaign has worked diligently to provide you with documentation and records in a prompt manner.”\n\n“We will do better” in the future, Barley said.\n\nMcIlhinney said itemizing the expenses would “creat(e) a lot of work for the campaign staff.”\n\n“I don’t know why we’d have to get too specific,” he said, adding, “These aren’t tax dollars.”\n\nMutchler said that’s hardly an excuse.\n\nSaying it “isn’t coming from state dollars” is “like applauding the fact that we clean up after ourselves when we leave a table,” she said.\n\n## Weak rules, little enforcement\n\nPennsylvania state lawmakers earn a minimum of $88,000 a year, with leadership raking in as much as $135,000. That is in addition to perks and benefits and, for some, income from other jobs. Their campaign accounts give them access to tens of thousands of dollars more, in some cases even millions, with few rules preventing them from spending it however they wish.\n\nWhat’s more, there’s little enforcement of the rules that do exist. Just three people in the Pennsylvania Department of State are responsible for keeping track of roughly 3,000 registered campaign committees and upwards of 10,000 to 12,000 campaign finance filings in busy election years. Its power is “solely administrative,” with no authority to issue advisory opinions or impose fines beyond a $10-per-day late fee for reports, a department spokesperson said.\n\nCampaigns are supposed to keep “vouchers” of their spending for the previous three years, and — if requested by a member of the public — they are supposed to make them available. The state department interprets vouchers to mean receipts, yet there’s no requirement they be itemized, and there’s no penalty if the candidates don’t keep them on file as required.\n\nReporters for The Caucus and [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) put that little-known provision of the law to the test, requesting credit card statements and receipts for campaigns with the highest amounts of obscured spending. The records provided form the basis of this investigation.\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\" data-analytics-label=\"dark-spending-top-20\" id=\"dark-spending-top-20__graphic\" data-iframe-fallback=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/dark-spending-top-20/fallback-mobile.jpg\" data-iframe-fallback-width=\"350\" data-iframe-fallback-height=\"814.001071236929\" data-iframe=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/dark-spending-top-20/index.html\" data-iframe-height=\"814.001071236929\" data-iframe-resizable></div>\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nAllowing lawmakers to shield their spending “is a huge impediment to transparency,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the Washington D.C.-based reform group Public Citizen, adding: “And the greatest damage is that it discourages the public and the press from seeing how campaign funds are spent. It is a very serious obstacle to public information.”\n\nMost states, and the federal government, require far more accountability, experts say.\n\nLouisiana explicitly forbids candidates from saying only that their campaign money was paid to a credit card company or to themselves as reimbursement. The same is true in Connecticut, where rules state that candidates must disclose the ultimate recipient of campaign money rather than bundling expenses into credit card payments or reimbursements.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission, which oversees candidates for federal office, mandates itemized credit card expenses to prevent campaigns from obscuring spending.\n\nTightening restrictions and improving disclosure in Pennsylvania, however, would require the approval of the very same legislators taking advantage of the current rules.\n\n“I see no interest by the Legislature in addressing it even when the law is screaming for reform,” said Larry Otter, a Bucks County lawyer who specializes in election law. “It is not in their enlightened self-interest.”\n\n## Running up the tab\n\nAs part of the investigation, The Caucus and [Spotlight PA](https://www.spotlightpa.org/) found more than 4,800 instances of obscured spending by nearly 300 campaigns. The purchases covered everything from the mundane, such as political consultants and yard signs, to the lavish and downright bizarre.\n\nTake the $146 promotional photo with ’70s trio Tony Orlando and Dawn and the $10 ultraviolet dog urine detector. Or the $5,184 trip to Las Vegas and the $2,123 worth of wine shipped from Napa Valley to southeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile campaign filings from lawmakers in both parties contained vague or veiled descriptions of credit card and other expenses, most of the state’s top legislative leaders — who raise and spend the most campaign cash — rose to the top, the records showed.\n\nOnly three of the six top legislative leaders provided itemized receipts. Others turned over credit card statements and some receipts that did not describe what was purchased.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Frank Dermody, D., Allegheny, didn’t provide the vast majority of receipts to explain $16,400 in credit card charges and $8,000 in reimbursements to himself from his campaign. The credit card charges included $3,900 in gift cards for Harrisburg area restaurants. The campaign did not document who used the cards.\n\nIn a statement, Dermody defended his spending as appropriate and “in full compliance with the law.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Bryan Cutler, a Republican from Lancaster County, was the only legislative leader who immediately turned over itemized receipts of his campaign’s spending. Most of Cutler’s spending had already been reported on his public forms. He had only $5,292 worth of expenses that were vaguely described as “reimbursements.”\n\n“I approach donor money very similar to how I approach taxpayer money,” he said. “You've entrusted me with it for the purposes of re-election. And so I try to ensure that it has a nexus to that.”\n\nCosta, the Senate minority leader, provided itemized receipts upon request. Unlike most other  lawmakers, he said he supports requiring state election officials to describe their campaign spending publicly with “more specificity,” including possibly banning the bundling of campaign expenditures.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Jake Corman, R., Centre, listed more than $73,000 in expenses as some variation of “credit card payment,” “campaign card 1” or “campaign card 2.”\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\" data-analytics-label=\"splcredit-corman\" id=\"splcredit-corman__graphic\" data-iframe-fallback=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/splcredit-corman/fallback-mobile.jpg\" data-iframe-fallback-width=\"350\" data-iframe-fallback-height=\"1018\" data-iframe=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/splcredit-corman/index.html\" data-iframe-height=\"1018\" data-iframe-resizable></div>\n\nHad Corman been required to itemize those expenses, the public would have seen $2,290 for 90 bottles of vodka in 2015, $1,908 on 90 bottles of rum in 2016, and $1,908 for another 90 bottles of rum in 2017, all for holiday gifts, according to records his campaign provided.\n\n“Sen. Corman has long advocated for transparency in the political process, including quicker disclosure of donations,” his campaign said in a statement, declining to elaborate on his spending. “The senator’s campaign committee, Friends of Jake Corman, has complied with all campaign finance laws, including disclosure requirements.”\n\nSome legislators took weeks or even months to provide the documents. Former Rep. Dom Costa, D., Allegheny, took six months to produce records and still has not released all of them.\n\nScarnati’s campaign also took six months to provide records and requested that reporters pay $1,800 to reimburse the campaign’s accountant for the time she spent assembling them. The campaign agreed to provide them without the preparation charge after a lawyer working on behalf of The Caucus intervened with the Department of State.\n\nWhen more documents were later requested, however, Scarnati’s campaign accountant again billed for her time. The news organizations have paid for copying costs, but are contesting the bill for the accountant’s time.\n\nFormer Sen. Allen Kukovich, a Democrat from Westmoreland County and leader on campaign finance reform efforts during his decades in the Legislature, said it should not take such an effort by reporters or the public to get basic information on how campaign funds are spent.\n\n“For a regular voter, getting that is just too onerous,” Kukovich said.\n\n## Scarnati’s spending\n\nScarnati, the leader of the Senate, topped the list of the nearly 300 campaigns with $246,000 in obscured expenses over the three years, including more than $130,000 described as “meals,” “meal expense” or “meals and entertainment.”\n\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"autotune\" data-analytics-label=\"spl-scarnati2\" id=\"spl-scarnati2__graphic\" data-iframe-fallback=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/spl-scarnati2/fallback-mobile.jpg\" data-iframe-fallback-width=\"350\" data-iframe-fallback-height=\"834\" data-iframe=\"https://media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/ai2html/spl-scarnati2/index.html\" data-iframe-height=\"834\" data-iframe-resizable></div>\n\nScarnati’s public campaign finance reports did not reveal that some of that spending was by two of his top taxpayer-paid Senate staffers — Drew Crompton, his chief of staff and general counsel, and Shelly Brown, his staff administrator — who each have a campaign credit card.\n\nThey ran up tens of thousands of dollars in expenses, including travel and meals, even though neither has a title or official role in his campaign, according to the records provided to the news organizations. Crompton, for instance, was in Las Vegas in May of last year for a trip he described as, in part, one for fundraising with casino executives.\n\nOne of his expenses during the trip: a $470 dinner at the Tao Las Vegas on the same night of his 50th birthday.\n\nAsked about the timing, Crompton said the trip was planned months in advance by Scarnati and that “no disrespect to my boss, but I don’t think he knows when my birthday is.”\n\nTabas said in a statement that none of Scarnati’s taxpayer-funded staffers have formal roles with the campaign. Some aides, he said, volunteer their time and are not compensated by the campaign. Tabas said the staffers sometimes charge the campaign for expenses that have “multiple purposes, which include the purpose to influence the outcome of an election.”\n\nCrompton said in an interview that when deciding whether to use taxpayer or campaign money for an event that involves mixed purposes, Scarnati’s “golden rule” is: “When in doubt, put it on the campaign.”\n\nAnother $24,000 was described in Scarnati’s public reports as “gifts,” “gift baskets” or “gifts and tokens,” with no indication of what the gifts were, who received them or where the senator’s campaign bought them.\n\nThe records obtained by the news organizations show some of the gifts were purchased from Scarnati’s personal business, a candy company co-owned with his wife, Amy, as well as Crompton and others. More than $7,000 worth of candy purchases were tucked in his credit card statements. Another $5,700 in similar candy expenses were disclosed publicly.\n\nTabas said the candy was bought “at cost” and the company made no profit.\n\nScarnati’s hidden spending also included the European tour as well as other trips to Paris, Las Vegas, Chicago, New York, Florida and Louisville — during the Kentucky Derby. The Europe trip was described in public reports with vague descriptions such as “lodging” and “travel expenses,” without any mention of his fine dining and hotel stays on another continent.\n\nMany other details of the trip remain unknown.\n\n<div id=\"310290d7-98f6-45bd-85fa-fbc41c167e3e\"></div>\n\n_Alyssa Biederman contributed to this report._\n\n_Coming Wednesday: How top lawmakers’ lavish trip to Europe with donors followed the passage of a landmark law expanding wine sales._\n",

			"body": "\nHARRISBURG — Pennsylvania’s largest community college system has eliminated all on-campus mental health counseling for its students, Spotlight PA has learned, a move college health experts called short-sighted and risky at a time of growing need.\n\nThe Harrisburg Area Community College (HACC) told counselors across its five campuses to stop individual and group counseling as of mid-September, according to an internal memo obtained by Spotlight PA. Instead, students with mental health needs will be sent to a dean of student affairs who will refer them to an off-campus provider.\n\nCounselors were verbally notified of the decision on Sept. 11, and the memo was sent to counselors and administrators on Sept. 25. The changes have not been publicly announced, and the college has yet to notify the entire student body.\n\nLike [other institutions](https://www.inquirer.com/education/college-enrollment-student-bucknell-muhlenberg-ursinus-dickinson-20190930.html) across the U.S., the community college — with campuses in Harrisburg, York, Lancaster, Lebanon and Gettysburg — has been [grappling with falling enrollment](https://www.hacc.edu/AboutHACC/InstitutionalEffectiveness/InstitutionalResearch/Enrollment.cfm) and a growing budget deficit, which currently [stands at $2.7 million](https://www.hacc.edu/AboutHACC/CollegeFactSheet/index.cfm). In 2014, the system served about 20,000 students. This year, that number is 17,400.\n\nAt the same time, state funding for community colleges has been nearly stagnant, with annual budget [increases of 2% or less](https://www.budget.pa.gov/PublicationsAndReports/CommonwealthBudget/Documents/2019-20%20Enacted%20Budget/2019-20%20Web%20Track%20-%20ENACTED.pdf).\n\nThe president of HACC, John Sygielski, said the elimination of mental health counseling on campus is part of [a larger reorganization](https://www.hacc.edu/AboutHACC/2019-22StrategicPlan/index.cfm) to streamline services across the college system. Counselors will continue to assist students with issues other than mental health, such as academic goal setting, career exploration, college and life balance, and connections to community resources for food, shelter and transportation.\n\n“There has been an increase in demand for virtual services and flexible services outside of regular office hours,” Sygielski said in a statement. “With the reorganization, external counseling services will augment the college’s services by providing extended hours and, in some cases, offer 24/7 service.”\n\nCollege mental health experts said eliminating on-campus counseling is risky given the persistent rise in the number of students [experiencing depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts](https://sites.psu.edu/ccmh/files/2019/01/2018-Annual-Report-1.30.19-ziytkb.pdf). Suicide is the [second-leading cause of death](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/images/lc-charts/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2017_1100w850h.jpg) for that age group, and the demand for campus counseling services has [nearly doubled over the past decade](https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201800332).\n\n“We’re in a period of time when a lot of colleges and universities either are increasing their mental health services or need to be,” said Marissa Meyers, who researches policies to support college students at the Hope Center for College, Community and Justice in Philadelphia. “What if a student who is depressed and seeks mental health services on campus doesn’t follow up with a local provider and attempts suicide?”\n\n**» _SEND A TIP:_** _We want to hear from college students, professors and parents about_ [_how campus mental health services are — or are not — working_](https://www.spotlightpa.org/tips)_, including the_  _availability of counseling services,_  _voluntary/involuntary leaves of absence_  _and any policies that treat students with mental illness differently._\n\nIn June 2018, Florida Polytechnic University, a small public college outside of Tampa, laid off its only mental health counselor. When a [student died by suicide on campus](https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/k12/At-Florida-Poly-a-student-suicide-and-a-question-Could-it-have-been-prevented-_170583324/) about a month later, many criticized the college for its decision.\n\nSeven years earlier, Pima Community College in Arizona [came under fire](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/us/14college.html) for not addressing the mental health concerns of Jared Lee Loughner. Three months after being suspended, he shot 19 people, including Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.\n\nA 2016 study found that about [50% of community college students](https://hope4college.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Wisconsin_HOPE_Lab-Too_Distressed_To_Learn.pdf) reported a mental health condition, a greater proportion than students at four-year colleges. In the past year at HACC, 427 students sought on-campus counseling for services other than academic advising, the community college said in its statement. Counselors classified 87 of those as mental health concerns.\n\nReferring students off campus adds another barrier to getting help, and many don’t follow through, said Laura Horne, chief program officer for Active Minds, a national nonprofit focused on college mental health. Students might not have the time or transportation, or they might lack insurance or the  means to pay for therapy.\n\nBy comparison, college counseling services are typically low or no cost.\n\n“It’s so short-sighted to cut services,” Horne said. “If students don’t get the help they need, they’ll be less likely to stay with the college or graduate.”\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nSygielski said the college is in discussions with a third party to provide clinical services at low or no cost, including virtual counseling options.\n\nFinding available counselors could be hard in some communities, said Meyers, of the Hope Center, and wait times for appointments can be weeks or months. According to the Department of Health, several areas of the state — including [the city of York](https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Health%20Planning/Designated%20Mental%20Health%20HPSAs%20List.pdf), where one of HACC’s campuses is located — have a shortage of mental health care providers.\n\nAnd although cutting counseling services may save money upfront, it will be more costly in the long run, said Annelle Primm, a licensed psychiatrist and senior medical director of The Steve Fund, a nonprofit focused on mental health for college students of color.\n\n“Students will suffer in silence and their mental health concerns could worsen to a crisis point,” Primm said, making it more likely they’ll drop out, be hospitalized or end up in the correctional system.\n\nA 2019 report prepared by The Healthy Minds Network found students with mental health problems are [twice as likely to leave school](https://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Investing-in-Student-Mental-Health.pdf). By keeping them in school and paying tuition, colleges can more than recoup the cost of mental health services, the authors wrote.\n\nStill, as community colleges struggle to balance budgets and keep tuition low, pooling resources with community providers can be a good option, said Martha Parham, senior vice president of public relations for the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\n“The college can focus on its educational mission and let professional mental health providers deliver that service,” she said.\n\nThree of Pennsylvania’s other public community college systems also refer students off campus for mental health counseling. Two of them are significantly smaller than HACC, but the Community College of Allegheny County is comparable, serving more than 15,000 students across four campuses.\n\nThe remaining 10 public community colleges offer on-campus mental health services, with the number of full-time counselors ranging from one at Pennsylvania Highlands Community College to 20 at the Community College of Philadelphia.\n\nNationally, [82% of community colleges](http://www.collegecounseling.org/resources/Documents/ACCA-Community-College-Survey-2014-15-Final.pdf) provide counseling on campus, according to a 2015 survey.\n\nAn alternative to eliminating on-campus counseling altogether is to contract with an outside agency to provide a counselor who practices on campus, said Horne, of Active Minds. That person is not on the college’s payroll, but they’re still easily accessible to students and understand the college’s unique needs.\n\nOther options include shortening counseling center hours or introducing a fee for services, said Ethan Fields, who works with the nonprofit JED Foundation to help colleges implement mental health services.\n\nIf schools do move to a referral-only system, it’s important they communicate that information clearly and repeatedly to everyone on campus, he said.\n\n“If no one knows where to get the help,” he said, “that’s where it’s really risky.”\n\n_If you are in crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text TALK to the Crisis Text Line at 741741._\n",

			"body": "NEW CASTLE — The cracked glass doors of the vacant post office building reflect back the historic town center. Behind the padlocks, a dusty staircase strewn with crumbled plaster leads to an empty foyer.\n\nAcross the town center, known by locals as “the Diamond” for its shape, another former anchor of downtown is dark. Once the headquarters of <a href=\"https://www.ncnewsonline.com/news/lights-still-out-at-former-penn-power-building/article_47af19b8-5869-11e7-9d98-27842280c6e1.html\">utility company Penn Power</a>, part of the cavernous ground floor now houses the city’s Christmas decorations. Wreaths of green tinsel stacked against the windows flash in the sunlight.\n\nBill Mitsos, 55, is the co-owner of the M&amp;P Coney Island hot dog restaurant, which is one door down from the Penn Power building. He said he remembers when the family business, founded in 1923, attracted a crowd every day for lunch. Now, almost all of their sales come from another location in the suburbs.\n\n“It’s one of the few places left downtown and we’ve kept it open on purpose,” Mitsos said.\n\nA federal tax incentive program passed in 2017 by Republicans in Congress has been hailed by President Trump as a lifeline for ailing Rust Belt cities like New Castle, where residents share an all-too-familiar struggle despite the rebound of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe central premise of the program is simple: offer wealthy investors generous tax breaks for putting money into real estate or businesses in distressed areas. Those areas were designated “opportunity zones.”\n\nIn Pennsylvania, however, early signs suggest the program is not living up to the claims of transformative change, and is unlikely to be a cure for the communities most in need of a boost. Instead, investors appear to mostly prefer areas already experiencing redevelopment, where the payday will be far greater.\n\n“It wouldn’t surprise me if the vast majority of investment went to a handful of zones in central cities that are already exploding with growth,” said Adam Looney, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, who <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/learning-from-opportunity-zones-how-to-improve-place-based-policies/\">has studied the program</a>.\n\nAnd the areas desperate for redevelopment? “Investors will mostly skip over those places,\" Looney said.\n\n<b>» </b><i><b>SEND A TIP:</b></i><i> Spotlight PA is following the money flowing through Pa.'s many economic development and grant programs. If you know of an investigation we should pursue, </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/tips/\"><i>securely send us a tip.</i></a>\n\nThere’s still plenty of time to take advantage of the program, and a lack of public reporting requirements makes it difficult to track exactly where the money is going. There are also clear success stories, like a <a href=\"https://thepearl.fund/\">business incubator planned near Scranton</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/topics/pnc-pov/community/opportunity-zone.html\">old warehouse being converted into apartments</a> in Bethlehem, and a <a href=\"https://coatesville.today/2019/05/qualified-opportunity-zone-attracts-new-company-to-coatesville/\">start-up company moving</a> from suburban Chester County into the city of Coatesville.\n\nPerhaps the most organized effort around the program <a href=\"https://www.flagshipopportunityzone.com/\">has been in Erie</a>, where local leaders said they have already secured roughly $13 million in new investment. The chamber of commerce has dedicated a full-time employee to the effort, and the city has aggressively marketed its zones, <a href=\"https://homecoming.eriepa.com/\">highlighted by a two-day “homecoming” event in August</a>, when attendees toured potential development sites.\n\nThe keynote speaker was Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, underscoring the politics inextricably linked with the program. The president <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-opportunity-zones-20190730-3b3koim5wfcovhnp6t32ja2h4m-story.html\">touts the tax incentive</a> as an example of how he has improved the lives of black residents in urban areas. But it’s unclear how much opportunity zone investments will directly affect the lives of residents in these communities, and, unlike some other economic incentive programs, there’s no requirement that projects show a clear public benefit.\n\n<b>» </b><i><b>READ MORE:</b></i><i> An in-depth look from our partners at PA Post at </i><a href=\"https://papost.org/2019/10/15/erie-lost-people-for-decades-now-leaders-there-hope-a-new-tax-break-will-transform-the-city/\"><i>how Erie is trying to use the tax incentive to help turn around its decline.</i></a>\n\nMost other areas designated as opportunity zones in Pennsylvania are far less organized than Erie, and some lack the resources to mount even a modest marketing campaign.\n\n“We just haven’t had the capacity to move forward with it,” said Sara Andrews, executive director of the Office of Economic and Community Development in Bradford, in northwestern Pennsylvania. “It’s very difficult for small communities.”\n\nIn Warren — one county over, on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest — “getting the designation was easier than trying to make use of it,” city manager Nancy Freenock said.\n\nJennifer Wakeman, executive director of DRIVE, an economic development agency serving Columbia and Montour counties, said there was no clear answer.\n\n“I don’t know how we make our rural area compete,” Wakeman said.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nThe primary benefit of investing in opportunity zones is that, after 10 years, any profits, or capital gains, are free from federal taxes. For real estate investors looking to maximize their returns, the most appealing deals are in places where property values are likely to soar over the next decade, yielding a tax-free windfall.\n\nBut in order to make money, you need to have money. Investors must already have earned capital gains — profits from selling stock or other investments. Only an <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/model-estimates/distribution-individual-income-tax-long-term-capital-gains-and-qualified-27\">estimated 8.6 percent of U.S. taxpayers</a> paid capital gains tax in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington, D.C. think tank.\n\nThose capital gains must be put into special funds dedicated to opportunity zones. Many of those funds have minimum investments starting at $100,000, or are open only to accredited investors — people who consistently earn more than $200,000 a year.\n\nWith more than 8,700 opportunity zones across the U.S., including 300 in Pennsylvania, investors that do make the cut have plenty of options, including fast-growing census tracts in Philadelphia that would likely see continued investment even without the tax breaks.\n\n“Unsurprisingly, Philadelphia has been receiving the most attention so far nationally, but a lot of other smaller cities in Pennsylvania are just as viable,” said Evan Weiss, an opportunity zone policy expert who works as an advisor for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\n<div id=\"map-container\"></div>\n\nAt the intersection of Jefferson Ave. and 31st St., in Philadelphia’s Brewerytown neighborhood, investment from an opportunity fund is helping to finance the conversion of a towering, redbrick former brewery into luxury loft apartments that will rent for between $1,000 and $2,200 a month. Once completed, the brewery will be the latest addition to a street already lined with new and modernized apartment buildings.\n\nDeveloper David Waxman, whose company has been working in the neighborhood for years, said the project was planned before the opportunity zone incentives became law — and would have gone ahead without them. Now, however, some investors stand to earn far greater profits.\n\nWaxman said development spreads outwards from thriving areas and, as time goes on, money may flow to the city’s less desirable zones, too. “You can’t just plop something down in the middle of an area that hasn’t seen investment,” he said.\n\nGov. Wolf had the final say over which eligible census tracts became opportunity zones, but largely followed the recommendations of local leaders. Officials at the city planning department said they tried to balance areas that were already growing with ones that had been starved of investment. Choosing only the most distressed neighborhoods, they said, would risk dampening investors’ interest.\n\nBut choosing fast-growing areas like Brewerytown could also risk accelerating gentrification. A study by the Urban Institute, a Washington D.C.-based think tank, found that almost a fifth of the city’s opportunity zones were <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/metropolitan-housing-and-communities-policy-center/projects/opportunity-zones-maximizing-return-public-investment\">already showing signs of “rapid socioeconomic change”</a> before they were chosen for the program.\n\nPittsburgh took a much different approach. Citing the risk that opportunity zone investments could cause “speculative pressure in vulnerable real estate markets” because of a lack of regulation, city officials recommended areas with little ongoing development activity.\n\n“Mayor Peduto is hopeful that if opportunity zones are implemented in Pittsburgh they would be tailored to neighborhoods that have not seen high levels of investment,” Timothy McNulty, the mayor’s spokesperson, said in a statement. “But that’s a big if — he remains cautious about the Trump administration implementing plans that truly benefit all.”\n\nIn presentations to local leaders, state officials have made clear the opportunity zone incentives aren’t powerful enough to make people invest where they otherwise wouldn’t.\n\nThe incentive, “doesn’t make bad deals good. It’s only going to make good deals better,” said Scott Deitrich, the state’s point person for opportunity zones, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMSpaxF30U0\">during a presentation in June</a>. “If investment is not occurring in real estate markets within your community already, it’s not likely that this incentive will spur that investment.”\n\nAnd so, despite the lofty claims around the program, it’s unclear where it leaves communities like Clairton, a small city in Allegheny County still struggling to recover from the collapse of the steel industry.\n\nAt Clairton Hardware — “industrial supplies since 1934” — the store is closed but the sign remains, red paint flaking to grey. Down the street, past several grassy vacant lots, “Jus Us In The Pink” has a “for rent” sign in the window next to leftover merchandise and decorations: a pink vase, a bundle of artificial blue hyacinths, a pair of white china dogs.\n\nCheryl Hurt, 72, said her mother opened the store in the late 1980s. Now, the building has problems with the roof and Hurt has fallen behind on the property taxes.\n\n“I’d almost be willing to give it away,” said Hurt, who runs a daycare a few blocks away. “It’s a nice place, it just needs some money put into it.”\n\nMayor Richard Lattanzi knows the things residents want — like a bank, more small shops and a grocery store — are not the most lucrative or enticing for investors. Aside from a Speedway gas station and convenience store built in 2017, “we haven’t seen any development here in years,” Lattanzi said.\n\nA consulting firm has created a map of opportunity zones, <a href=\"https://www.developadvisors.com/opportunity-zones-index/\">color-coded according to their “baseline economic fundamentals” </a>— or, put another way, places poised for growth that could turn a profit for investors. The most attractive areas are dark blue. Clairton, at the other end of the spectrum, is a cluster of orange and dark red.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/\"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> receives </i><a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/support/\"><i>funding from nonprofit institutions and readers like you</i></a><i> who are committed to investigative journalism that gets results.

[Sign up for our free weekly newsletter](https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/)._\n\nIn the past two years, more than $150 million has poured into Pennsylvania to combat the opioid crisis, [nearly doubling the rate of per capita spending](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tracking-Federal-Funding-to-Combat-the-Opioid-Crisis.pdf). Most of that money has come from the federal government, which has given the Commonwealth [the second most of any state](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/09/04/state-opioid-response-grants-by-state.html), second to California. Other money has come [from philanthropic grants](https://whyy.org/articles/bloomberg-philanthropies-gives-pennsylvania-10-million-to-reduce-overdose-deaths/).\n\n\n\nBy some measures, the influx of cash is working: The state’s overdose death rate [decreased by 18% in 2018](https://data.pa.gov/stories/s/9q45-nckt/), the first drop in at least five years, and [hospital admissions for overdoses are also going down](https://www.eveningsun.com/story/news/2019/09/18/pa-phc-4-study-finds-decrease-opioid-overdose-hospitalization-admission/2350179001/). But the rush of dollars also raises important questions about where the money is going, how well it’s being spent and if patients are getting the best treatment.\n\n\n\nWe want your help investigating the business of addiction treatment in Pennsylvania.\n\nMore than 200 residential facilities and 600 outpatient providers are licensed by the state, a number that has grown by about one third in the past five years, according to the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs. Pennsylvania is also home to more than 3,700 medical providers who are allowed to prescribe buprenorphine, a type of medication-assisted treatment, on an outpatient basis.\n\n\n\nThese facilities and providers are subject to a host of federal and state regulations. But a [2017 report from the auditor general](https://www.paauditor.gov/press-releases/auditor-general-depasquale-says-multi-agency-attack-on-opioid-epidemic-shows-progress-audit-outlines-path-toward-greater-success) found the Pennsylvania agencies responsible for overseeing addiction treatment struggle to collect accurate data and monitor the effectiveness of their programs, in some cases due to underfunding and understaffing.\n\n\n\nWe want to fill in the gaps, and we need your help. **Using the form below, please share your stories of the struggle to access addiction treatment, predatory providers, inadequate or negligent care and a lack of oversight causing harm to vulnerable residents.** We’d also like to hear the success stories and models for efficient and effective treatment.\n\n\n\nAs the lead reporter on this effort, I assure you we take your privacy seriously and will treat your information with the sensitivity it deserves.

			"body": "The Pennsylvania State Police, the third-largest statewide law enforcement agency in the country, has stopped collecting data on the race of drivers its troopers pull over, making it far more difficult to detect bias, Spotlight PA has learned.\n\nThe change, which was never publicly announced, was made by the State Police in 2012 and has remained in place despite national attention on race and policing in recent years and the widely accepted value of collecting such data for analysis.\n\nComprised of about 4,700 troopers, the Pennsylvania State Police is one of only 11 statewide law enforcement agencies in the U.S. that does not collect race data during stops, and by far the largest, according to a Spotlight PA survey of all 50 states.\n\nSimilarly sized state police agencies in New York and New Jersey both collect the data.\n\n“It makes it look like you either don’t care about disparities or you are trying to hide what the data shows,” said Christy Lopez, a professor at Georgetown Law and former official in the U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “And that undermines police legitimacy.”\n\nWhen initially asked why data collection was discontinued, a spokesman for the State Police said it was based on studies that found no evidence of racial disparities in traffic stops. One of those studies had, however, identified “racial, ethnic, and gender disparities” in how troopers dealt with motorists after they were stopped.\n\n<div id=\"race-map-container\">\n</div>\n\nOn Sept. 17, after being presented with the findings of Spotlight PA’s nationwide survey, State Police officials said the agency would reverse course and resume collection next year.\n\n“We do feel that collecting this information would yield valuable statistical information for the department,” Lt. Col. Scott Price, the deputy commissioner of administration and professional responsibility, said in an email.\n\nThe agency declined a request for an interview with its leader, Commissioner Robert Evanchick. The union representing state troopers declined comment. Gov. Tom Wolf’s spokesman, J.J. Abbott, said the administration supports the State Police’s decision to resume tracking the race of drivers involved in traffic stops.\n\n_**» DONATE NOW:**_ _If you value accountability journalism that drives change like this report on the Pennsylvania State Police, [support our reporters and become a Founding Donor](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate/)._\n\nIn June, the ACLU of Pennsylvania filed a federal lawsuit against the State Police alleging troopers were violating the law by [stopping and holding people based solely on their Latino appearance](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania-troopers-aclu-lawsuit-latinos-immigration-ice-no-sanctuary-20190627.html). And in July, a black couple, Rodney and Angela Gillespie of Chadds Ford, [told The Inquirer they were profiled and harassed by a white trooper](https://www.inquirer.com/news/rodney-gillespie-angela-pennsylvania-state-police-chadds-ford-state-trooper-driving-while-black-racial-profiling-20190803.html) in the driveway of their home in suburban Philadelphia. They are considering a lawsuit.\n\nWitold Walczak, the legal director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania and a lead lawyer in the federal lawsuit, said he was unaware the agency had seven years ago  stopped collecting race data from traffic stops.\n\n“If you are serious about addressing any kind of discriminatory conduct in law enforcement, you have to keep this data — it’s absolutely essential,” Walczak said.\n\nAcross the country, 25 statewide law enforcement agencies collect data on every stop made by a trooper or highway patrol officer, Spotlight PA’s  survey found. Another 13 gather information on race when a stop results in some type of law enforcement action, such as a ticket or a search. (Hawaii does not have a statewide patrol.)\n\nLopez, the former Justice Department official, said Pennsylvania should follow best practices and collect data for every stop, regardless of whether a warning or citation is issued. The agency should also record what happens during a stop, like whether a search is conducted and whether contraband is found.\n\nAnd it needs a process for regular analysis, she said. In New Jersey, for example, where a racial profiling scandal in the 1990s led to 10 years of federal oversight of the state police, an office was created to monitor for bias and issue public reports.\n\n“We need to know whether officers are treating people differently who are of different races, whether they are doing so intentionally or otherwise,” Lopez said.\n\nTracking race during traffic stops is also in the best interest of Pennsylvania troopers, she said. Not only does it build trust with the community, but it could potentially help the agency defend itself against unfounded lawsuits and profiling accusations. Ryan Tarkowski, a spokesman for the State Police, said the agency was still determining how its new data collection program would be implemented.\n\nQuestions remain about why the department stopped collecting race data in 2012.\n\nAccording to archived news reports, the State Police tracked the data from traffic stops until the mid-1970s. It resumed collection in 2002 as part of a project with the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cincinnati. Researchers involved in the project could not be reached for comment.\n\nA report released in 2004 found “no consistent evidence” that troopers were making stops based on a drivers’ race or ethnicity. But it found what it called “racial, ethnic, and gender disparities” in how troopers dealt with motorists once they had pulled them over.\n\nThe odds of black drivers being arrested and searched, for instance, were 1.5 to 3 times higher than white drivers. The odds of Latino drivers being arrested and searched were 1.8 to 2.7 times higher. The report also noted minority drivers were “significantly less likely to be in possession of contraband compared to white drivers who are searched.”\n\nA second report, released in 2005, found troopers had made improvements, but recommended the State Police continue collecting the data.\n\nThe decision to end the practice in 2012 was made by the State Police executive staff in place at the time, led by former Commissioner Frank Noonan, said Price, the current deputy commissioner.\n\nIn an interview, Noonan told Spotlight PA  he was unaware of the change.\n\n“I don’t remember that coming up to me,\" said Noonan, who was nominated by Republican Gov. Tom Corbett and who left the position in late 2014.\n\n{{<newsletter-inline>}}\n\nThe policy continued under his successors, including Evanchick. It wasn’t until this week, in response to questions from Spotlight PA, that the department said it would resume tracking race.\n\nPrice said the agency could not find documentation that pointed to a single reason for ending the practice. He said the department’s current leadership believes it was driven by the cost of analyzing the data — about $140,000 per year to the University of Cincinnati — and findings that consistently showed a lack of racial bias. The cost amounts to about .01% of the State Police’s annual budget of $1.3 billion.\n\nNational policing experts said the rationale was difficult to understand.\n\nChris Burbank, vice president of strategic partnerships for the Center for Policing Equity and Salt Lake City’s former police chief, was skeptical that the department’s data showed no signs of racial bias. Even if true, Burbank said, that wasn’t a reason to stop collecting it to detect for potential bias.\n\n\"By that measure, if crime has gone down, do you not measure crime anymore?\" Burbank said.\n\nPrice said the State Police provides rigorous anti-bias training, starting with cadets at the academy. And every patrol vehicle has a camera system that captures audio and video that is reviewed by supervisors.\n\n“The Pennsylvania State Police does not tolerate bias-based policing of any kind,” Price said. “Fair and impartial enforcement of the law is mandated not only by written policy, but also by the culture of the department.”\n\nAccording to statistics provided by the State Police, the agency has received 56 complaints of racial profiling since 2014. Of those, its own internal investigations determined only two were founded. There were 19 profiling complaints filed in 2018, according to the agency. None were sustained.\n\n_Charlotte Keith contributed to this report._\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://pym.nprapps.org/pym.v1.min.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n    window.pymParent = new pym.Parent('race-map-container', 'https://interactives.data.spotlightpa.org/2019/vis-map-tile-usa-psp/', {});\n</script>\n",

Bob Godshall, a Republican from Montgomery County [who retired last year after 36 years in office](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/state/pa-state-rep-bob-godshall-of-montco-to-retire-after-three-decades-20180118.html). When lawmakers went to Harrisburg for session in the beginning of his career “it was for a purpose,” Godshall said.\n\n_**» DONATE NOW:**_ _In-depth, data-driven journalism like this exclusive analysis of productivity in the legislature takes enormous time and resources to produce._ [_Become a Founding Donor today and show your support_](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate)_._\n\nLegislative leaders and some outside experts caution there is only so much information to be gleaned by analyzing the number of bills, which speaks only to the amount of legislation and not its contents. For example, lawmakers sometimes forgo individual bills and instead tuck them into larger, omnibus measures. Or they could be focusing on more complex or higher-quality legislation, or spending more time helping constituents.\n\n“Just sheer volume of bills, whether introduced, voted, passed or signed does not tell the whole story,” said Mike Straub, a spokesman for House Republicans. “We believe the success of our chamber is not measured in bill volume, but in how our constituents respond to our members.”\n\nHis words were echoed by Republicans in Senate leadership and Democrats in both chambers. Many of them said the first six months of this year were particularly productive, perhaps a sign that things could be turning around. Lawmakers — who earn annual salaries ranging from $88,610 for freshmen to $138,327 for top leadership, plus other perks and benefits — have been on summer recess since June, and will return to  the Capitol  this month.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Jay Costa, a Democrat from Allegheny County, said he hopes to see more movement on legislation this fall. That hope, however, comes on the heels of an angry eruption earlier this year when [debate over a cash-assistance program for the poor devolved into a shouting match](https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania-senate-general-assistance-fetterman-scarnati-chaos-fight-20190626.html).\n\n“I think that we should consider having some policy that provides for members the opportunity, possibly, to vote on some measures that sometimes get stalled,” Costa said.\n\n{{<promo>}}\n\nAs part of their analysis, The Inquirer and Spotlight PA examined legislative data tracking bills and their progress in each two-year  session dating to 1975-76. The most activity came in the three sessions from 1991 to 1996, when lawmakers introduced an average of 5,081 bills per session. During that time, power in the legislature and governor’s office was sometimes held by one party and sometimes split between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe number of bills introduced hit new lows in the three most recently completed sessions, from 2013 through 2018, with an average of 3,903 bills each. In the 2013-14 session, Republicans controlled the legislature and governor’s office. In the years since, a Democrat has served as governor and the GOP has run the legislature.\n\nIn the last full session, 2017-18, half of all state representatives introduced 10 bills or fewer.\n\n<iframe title=\"Fewer bills introduced\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-xrwm1\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xrwm1/8/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"416\"></iframe>\n\nMore than 600 bills were passed in each of the four consecutive sessions from 1975 through 1982, when power was sometimes held by one party and sometimes split. Last session, when Republicans controlled the Legislature and a Democrat held the governor’s office, that number was 286.\n\n<iframe title=\"Passing fewer laws\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-u6j9l\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u6j9l/5/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"437\"></iframe>\n\nThose largely ceremonial resolutions, however, continued to see dramatic increases. Since the early 1970s, the number introduced has more than quadrupled to 1,670 last session. Godshall said the trend was “ridiculous,” adding that resolutions are primarily intended to generate publicity for lawmakers.\n\n“There are so many resolutions, there are so many days that are dedicated to this or that, that we have to run out of days,” he said.\n\n<iframe title=\"Resolutions on the rise\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-7w4rC\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7w4rC/7/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"416\"></iframe>\n\nTheir use can be partly attributed to the difficulty finding compromise for meaningful legislation. Some veteran lawmakers said it has been harder to get work done as the legislature has become more polarized, especially when a wave of conservatives were elected in 2010 and, more recently, with a slew of new, progressive Democrats.\n\n<iframe title=\"Growing partisanship in the Pa. House\" aria-label=\"Range Plot\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-Nvy5W\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Nvy5W/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" height=\"583\"></iframe>\n\nResearchers at Princeton University and the University of Houston examined [legislators’ voting records](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1676863) in state capitols across the country to measure the growing divide between liberals and conservatives and its impact on a functioning government.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2016, that divide got significantly worse in the Pennsylvania House, while in the Senate, the gap slightly improved. In the most recent election, which is not yet included in the data, a wave of more progressive Democrats joined the House and Senate, which could push the parties farther apart.\n\nState Rep. Thomas Caltagirone, a Democrat from Berks County who has been in office for 43 years, said shifts are palpable. He blamed “young firebrands in both parties” in the House.\n\n“Years ago, you could negotiate and compromise on various issues, but now it’s like a line in the sand — don’t you dare cross it,” Caltagirone said.\n\nBut he also suggested there’s just not as much for the Legislature to fix these days.\n\n“Part of it is that maybe we’ve addressed most of the issues that needed to be addressed,” Caltagirone said. “I mean, the problems, some of them are getting solved. Some of the issues have gone away. That’s not to say there’s not areas that need to be addressed.”\n\nState Rep. Jordan Harris, a Democrat from Philadelphia and the party’s whip in the House, suggested some lawmakers are trying to be more deliberate about which bills they introduce. He brought forth a total of eight bills (and 15 resolutions) in his first six years in Harrisburg, and this year introduced two so far, the data shows.\n\n“It takes a lot of effort to actually focus on different pieces of legislation and shepherd them through the process to get to the governor’s desk,” Harris said. “I don’t introduce 40, 50 pieces of legislation a session. I introduce a few … that I can focus on.”\n\nTo become law, a bill must survive committee votes and multiple floor votes in both chambers before going to the governor for approval.\n\nHarris said passing bills is particularly difficult for the minority party. Of the 87 that became law so far this session, only one had a Democratic prime sponsor.\n\nIn recent years, some lawmakers have floated the idea trimming their own ranks and cutting the size of the 253-member state legislature. That would require an amendment to the state constitution. In order to do so, a bill must pass in identical form in two consecutive legislative sessions, and then get approval from voters.\n\nThose efforts have failed.\n\n<!-- datawrapper resizer -->\n<script>\n  window.addEventListener(\"message\", function(a) {\n    if (void 0 !== a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])\n      for (var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]) {\n        var t =\n          document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\" + e) ||\n          document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + e + \"']\");\n        t && (t.style.height = a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e] + \"px\");\n      }\n  });\n</script>\n",

			"body": "HARRISBURG — Nicole Hatem thought she was in a good spot when she graduated from Philadelphia’s Jefferson College of Nursing in May. She had landed a job offer to be a staff nurse at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and was slated to start in July. All she needed to do was pass her license exam.\n\nTo register for it, Hatem, 27, needed to go through the Pennsylvania Board of Nursing. She said she submitted her application May 24. The calendar changed to June, then July. Local testing centers began reaching capacity. She began to call the board almost daily. Hold times were about an hour, she said, and responses were flippant. They told her to wait and stop wasting their time with her calls.\n\nAfter months of stress, she asked her state senator for help and only then did her approval arrive — just in time for her to start her new job.\n\n“While there were real-life consequences for me, it felt as though there was no accountability on their end or even willingness to care,” Hatem said, adding it was a “truly terrible” process.\n\nIn late 2016, Pennsylvania began rolling out a new, centralized electronic system for its 29 licensing boards — which oversee everything from nurses to barbers to funeral directors — and championed it as the solution to piles of paperwork and long wait times.\n\nBut the rollout of that system, now estimated at $10 million, has taken longer than anticipated. According to interviews with nurses, lawmakers, and state officials, it’s frustrating to use and hasn’t fixed long-standing problems. On top of it all, the Board of Nursing recently imposed or increased 68 different fees for the roughly 295,000 licensed nurses in the state.\n\n“It certainly appears that the board is not well-enough equipped,” said State Sen. Maria Collett, a Democrat who represents parts of Bucks and Montgomery Counties and a registered nurse herself. Collett said her office has intervened with the board on behalf of nurses who couldn’t get a straight answer.\n\n“We’re not doing what we can,” she said.\n\n_**» DONATE NOW:**_ _If you value accountability journalism like this report exposing problems nurses face when dealing with the state Board of Nursing,_ [_support our reporters and become a Founding Donor_](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate)_._\n\nLast year, a review of all licensing boards ordered by Gov. Tom Wolf found that the nursing board’s initial processing time averaged 17 days. But when pressed this month, acting Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, who oversees the boards, told Spotlight PA she has “no confidence” in that number.\n\n“I’m going to start out by telling you: I don’t know what that report, what those numbers, refer to,” Boockvar said. “It was very disturbing to me.”\n\nBoockvar said that in June, she requested a review of licensing board data and found the average total processing time for registered nurses in 2018 was 88 days.\n\nMany nurses get caught in the first phase of that process, from the time a graduate like Hatem applies to the time they’re approved to take the test. Just that first part took an average of 37.5 days last year, Boockvar said.\n\nBy comparison, that same first phase in New Jersey takes eight days, and in Ohio, it’s between three and 10, according to licensing board officials in both states.\n\nBoockvar, who has worked in nonprofit health-care administration and was previously responsible for staffing nurses, said she was not surprised by people’s experiences with the delays.\n\n“I have to admit, I did find the Board of Nursing very frustrating from the outside world,” she said.\n\n{{<promo>}}\n\nBut she said there were clear signs of progress. Preliminary data on this year’s processing times show improvement, she said, and she is optimistic that will continue. She added that in April, she hired a new director of operations specifically tasked with identifying the causes of delays across all boards.\n\n“All the trends are positive,” Boockvar said.\n\nMembers of the nursing board did not respond to requests for comment. Ian Harlow, who ran the Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs at the time the new system was first implemented, declined comment. Harlow is now deputy secretary for regulatory programs.\n\nThe governor’s spokesman, J.J. Abbott, said in a statement: “Discrepancies and data concerns such as this are one of the many reasons the department undertook the major effort of replacing the prior system.”\n\nExactly how the review ordered by Wolf arrived at such a drastically different processing time for the Board of Nursing remains unclear. Alanna Wilson, who was involved in the review as part of her work with the Knee Center for the Study of Occupational Regulation near Altoona, Pa., said that processing time determinations were left up to the board.\n\nHarlow and the then-chair of the Board of Nursing, Linda Kmetz, took part in the review.\n\n“The boards who had the most to gain — or to lose — showed up,” Wilson said. “The nursing board was very involved.”\n\nNurses across the state said problems weren’t limited to license approval times. They also reported curt responses and long hold times on the phone when they called with questions. Some calls were left on hold for hours, they said, at times until the office closed, at which point calls disconnected.\n\nBoockvar disputed these claims, saying average hold times were nine to 10 minutes. There was no excuse for rudeness, she said, but added that nursing board staff hadn’t yet gone through customer service training.\n\nIn July, Boockvar said the Board of Nursing discovered and removed a dead-end phone number from its website. But in August, a call by a Spotlight PA reporter was met with an automated greeting and then a dead line. A second call was then put on hold for about 25 minutes until someone answered.\n\nBoockvar said the board was migrating to a new phone system.\n\n“Phones are so frustrating,” she said.\n\nNicholas Caruso, a nurse practitioner, said he recently moved from Monroeville in Allegheny County to Las Vegas and saw a huge difference. The Nevada Board of Nursing “picks up on the second ring and answers any questions right away,” Caruso said.\n\nLauren Narbey, a 31-year-old certified nurse-midwife in Pittsburgh, said she has to file for a license every time she wants to work alongside a new physician. She most recently filed in July. When Narbey called the Board of Nursing last week, she said, she waited on hold for a half hour.\n\nNarbey’s business with the board hasn’t yet been integrated into the new electronic system, meaning she had to mail in paper forms for approval. She has yet to receive a reply — or her new license.\n",

It’s powered by [The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/), the state’s pillar of investigative journalism, in partnership with the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://www.post-gazette.com/) and [PennLive/Patriot-News](https://www.pennlive.com/) in Harrisburg.\n\nIn just the past seven years, they’ve collectively won four Pulitzer Prizes — the highest honor in American journalism — and had multiple Pulitzer finalists.\n\nWhile we’re based in Harrisburg, Spotlight PA serves everyone in the commonwealth.\n\nWe’re collaborating closely with [PA Post](https://www.papost.org/), a new statehouse reporting project by Central Pennsylvania’s beloved public radio station, [WITF](https://www.witf.org/), as well as [The Caucus](http://caucuspa.com/), a watchdog print publication focused on the capital and produced by [LNP Media Group](https://lnpmediagroup.com/), the leading source of news in Lancaster County.\n\nWe’re extending our partnerships to academia, working hand-in-hand with Temple University’s Klein College of Media and Communication to create a new service to help Spotlight PA request, clean, analyze, and localize important statewide datasets as part of its investigative work.\n\nAnd we’re committed to being a collaborative partner with other local newsrooms across the state. Over the coming year, we’ll [work with newsroom leaders to grow our partnerships](https://www.spotlightpa.org/contact/) and share our resources and content free of charge to provide as many people as possible access to high-quality state government news.\n\nSpotlight PA’s independent team of a dozen journalists will work from a new office located two blocks from the Capitol. Our eight investigative reporters include Pennsylvania veterans [Angela Couloumbis](https://www.inquirer.com/author/couloumbis_angela/), [Liz Navratil](https://www.inquirer.com/author/navratil_liz/), and [Daniel Simmons-Ritchie](https://papost.org/author/daniel-simmons-ritchie/), as well as other accomplished professionals recruited from across the U.S. with diverse backgrounds and skills.\n\nThe formation of Spotlight PA marks the single largest expansion of the statehouse reporting corps in Pennsylvania in recent history, and, at launch, will be the largest newsroom dedicated solely to reporting on the state government and urgent statewide issues.\n\nOur journalists will be assigned to cover specific state departments, commissions, and agencies, as well as topics of statewide importance. Many of these areas have gone without serious scrutiny from the press for years. Spotlight PA reporters will have the time, resources, and mandate to be fearless in their pursuit of the truth.\n\nFar from just providing the news, we intend to connect and engage with you through innovative digital storytelling, creative partnerships, community events, and more.\n\nThis important journalism, however, is hardly free to produce.\n\nInitial financial support for Spotlight PA comes from the [Lenfest Institute for Journalism](https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/) and a first-ever [coalition of nearly a dozen other national and Pennsylvania community nonprofits](https://www.spotlightpa.org/support/) that recognize the importance that the decisions and actions in Harrisburg have on their communities, from Erie to York, Pittsburgh to Philadelphia.\n\nThey also know and agree that our work must be independent and free from influence. Spotlight PA retains full editorial control, and our funders have no say whatsoever about which stories we pursue or how we pursue them.\n\nBut the future of this unique endeavor rests in your hands. If you believe Pennsylvania’s government should answer to you, be honest with you, be transparent and responsive to your needs, please [become a Founding Donor to Spotlight PA and show your support](https://www.spotlightpa.org/donate) for our team of professional and nonpartisan journalists. If you’re not ready to join the effort now, judge us by our work and let us earn your trust.\n\nIn the coming weeks, you’ll begin to see Spotlight PA stories on [Inquirer.com](http://inquirer.com/) and across The Philadelphia Inquirer network. This new, high-quality reporting from the state capital is yet another example of The Inquirer’s [commitment to indispensable journalism](https://www.inquirer.com/about/a/philadelphia-inquirer-local-news-journalism-20190331.html), made possible by its passionate subscribers throughout the region.\n\nWe also need your help to uncover wrongdoing. Many of the most impactful investigations start with a call or email from a concerned reader. If you have tips or suggestions for an investigation, please visit [spotlightpa.org/tips](http://spotlightpa.org/tips) to see the various secure ways you can communicate with our team.\n\nEver since my first job as a local reporter in the Lehigh Valley for [The Morning Call](https://www.mcall.com/) — and most recently as investigations editor in New Jersey’s largest newsroom, [NJ.com](http://nj.com/) and [The Star-Ledger](https://www.nj.com/starledger/) — I have seen how hard-hitting investigative journalism can drive change and improve lives, especially for those who are marginalized or forgotten.\n\nNow, after having lived in Pennsylvania for more than a decade, I’m proud to be leading such an ambitious effort to provide the people of this state more of the high-quality investigative journalism we all need and deserve.
