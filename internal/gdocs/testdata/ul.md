HARRISBURG — Officials and experts in Pennsylvania are confident that new technology and growing familiarity with mail ballots among poll workers will make for smooth sailing during the upcoming Nov. 7 election.

On the ballot are critical appellate court races as well as ones for county-level and municipal positions. Odd-year elections like this one tend to see lower turnout. That makes the odds of long polling place lines and overloaded, sluggish ballot counting much lower.

As of Friday morning, the Department of State had <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/About-Elections/Pages/Election-Results.aspx">received more than <mark>998,453</mark> requests</a> for mail ballots — up from<a href="https://data.pa.gov/Government-Efficiency-Citizen-Engagement/2021-General-Election-Mail-Ballot-Approved-Voter-R/teba-zcwg"> the roughly 960,000 requests</a> it received in total for 2021, the previous odd-year election.

During the 2020 election, the commonwealth implemented widespread mail voting for the first time while dealing with pandemic-induced postal delays and intense national attention. Since then, many of the kinks have been worked out.

The 2020 experience is “something that hopefully we’ll never have to go through again,” said Jeff Greenburg, a former Mercer County election director who now works as an advisor for the good government group Committee of Seventy.

“Counties have adjusted,” Greenburg said, noting that many of those adjustments have been technical. “They know the amount of space they need to count in-person and mail ballots. They’ve purchased openers and slicers and sorters. And that was huge. None of us had that in 2020. Everything was done by hand.”

In 2020, it took some counties including Philadelphia days to finish counting mail ballots, leading to long waits for unofficial election results. A big cause of the wait was the <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pennsylvania-election-2020-counting-results-delays-mail-ballots/">legislature’s failure to give officials</a> time ahead of Election Day to begin processing mail ballots, and gave former President Donald Trump a window to spread <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/dec/06/fact-checking-false-claims-about-pennsylvania-and-/">misinformation</a> claiming a stolen election.

Lawmakers have yet to give counties additional time to process mail ballots. But thanks to other adjustments, Nick Custodio — spokesperson for the city’s commissioners, who run the elections — said this year Philadelphia is anticipating that results will begin appearing online as soon as polls close at 8 p.m.

Whether races can be called that night depends, as always, on how close they are. Counties don’t finish counting every ballot until days after the election — military ballots from overseas are allowed to be accepted after the election, and counties often need more time to check provisional ballots, which are often cast when it’s unclear if a voter is eligible.

But Custodio predicted a speedy resolution.

“We’ll have the vast majority of ballots \[counted\] by the time polls close,” he said.

There have been some scattered issues in the lead-up to Election Day.

Several counties this year have had ballot printing problems. Lancaster, for instance, <a href="https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania-politics/new-problems-arise-with-lancaster-countys-mail-in-ballots/">mistakenly directed mail voters</a> to put their ballot in a white secrecy envelope, instead of the yellow one the ballot came with. In some wards in Wilkes-Barre, in Luzerne County, a data issue led about 1,500 people to <a href="https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/luzerne-county/luzerne-county-officials-vow-to-fix-current-ballot-problems-mail-in-secrecy-envelope-voting-election/523-e76ae40f-b9de-4f8f-9bb7-59fa312e6793#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20week%2C%20the%20county,are%20sending%20out%20new%20ballots.">receive ballots with the wrong local races on them</a>. York County <a href="https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/york-county/error-discovered-400-york-county-mail-ballots-affected-voters-instructed-destroy-misprints/521-74a9acce-e72e-4737-a463-42efc387a1fe">accidentally sent duplicate ballots</a> to 400 or so voters.

Mistakes like these aren’t malicious, Greenburg said, and they’re relatively rare. But he added that mail voters should always keep an eye on their mail for corrections or warnings from counties about ballot problems, just in case.

In cases like this, counties almost always send a replacement ballot or instructions to correct a possible error, he said: “My fear, though, is that once a voter has submitted a ballot already, they may get another mailing and disregard it as junk mail.”

## More pollbooks, no last-minute election advice

Ahead of Election Day, Pennsylvania has made a few changes that affect registration and the in-person voting experience.

The state recently implemented a form of automatic voter registration through the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. When qualified people obtain a driver’s license, they are now prompted to opt out of registering to vote, instead of having to opt in.

Secretary of State Al Schmidt said at a press conference this month that the change seems to have led to a boost in registrations this year.

Since Sept. 19, Schmidt said the commonwealth had received more than 11,000 new voter registrations. In the same period in 2021, he said there were about 7,000.

Counties are also increasingly piloting electronic pollbooks, a piece of technology that is becoming more common around the country but has remained rare in Pennsylvania.

For voters, the change means signing in at in-person polling places using a tablet, rather than a paper booklet.

Behind the scenes, the differences are much bigger. With paper pollbooks, election workers have to print out reams of sign-in sheets weeks ahead of time and add supplements if new voters register close to the deadline. It’s also time-consuming to perform pollbook reconciliation using paper — the process involves scanning the barcode next to every eligible voter’s name into the commonwealth’s SURE system, to ensure nobody double-voted.

According to DOS, <a href="https://www.vote.pa.gov/About-Elections/Pages/New-Voting-Systems.aspx">19 of the commonwealth’s 67 counties</a> are currently using electronic pollbooks including Philadelphia.

The city launched electronic pollbooks during this year’s May primary. A previous effort, in 2019, was temporarily abandoned <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/philadelphia/philly-epollbook-electronic-systems-should-not-be-used-city-says-20190917.html">due to technical issues</a>.

“We were able to run ballot security checks \[pollbook reconciliation\] much faster than with the paper pollbooks,” Custodio said.

Another process change came directly from the Department of State. Schmidt, the first-year department secretary and former Philadelphia city commissioner, said he will not hand down new guidance to counties within 45 days of an election, unless a last-minute court ruling or some other unavoidable change makes it necessary.

This came up repeatedly in 2020, a year in which voters’ and election workers’ lack of familiarity with mail ballots led to errors and confusion. At one point, the then-secretary of state instructed counties to notify voters of ballot mistakes and have them <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/12/pennsylvania-election-2020-act-77-mail-voting-republican-audit/">vote by provisional ballot instead</a>, so their votes could still be counted. It was <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/01/pennsylvania-senate-electoral-college-objection-donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-election/">one of the examples Republicans later raised</a> in their attempts to delay certification of the election.

Last-minute advice, Schmidt said at a recent press conference, “was a real frustration for me while running elections.”

Looming over 2023 is the much larger, higher-pressure 2024 presidential election, which will also feature races for U.S. Senate, Pennsylvania’s three row offices, and the state House and Senate.

Election officials on the state and county level said they don’t see this year’s election as practice; with their radically different turnout and numbers of races on the ballot, the two kinds of elections are just too different.

“We’ve been preparing for 2024 since the day after the 2020 general election,” Custodio said. “We have never stopped planning. We don’t see any one election as a dry run. It’s its own special thing.”

- It was frustrating for me as a commissioner. This year we put in place a deadline for issuing guidance, which is 45 days before the election. We did that the other day. There are things not under our control, like court decisions that come last-minute. But in those cases, we do try to act expeditiously to give election admin as much time as possible to adjust.

New election equipment is expensive. The investment was possible for many counties because last year, state lawmakers had a rare moment of election policy consensus and <a href="https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/uconsCheck.cfm?yr=2022&amp;sessInd=0&amp;act=88">passed a law</a> that, among other things, gave counties funds to hire staff and buy certain equipment, <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2023/7/28/23810643/pennsylvania-act-88-election-budget-grants-mail-ballot-counting/">like mail ballot sorters</a>. Some counties also dipped into their own coffers — Custodio noted that Philly, for instance, boosted its election budget last year.

DOS AGAIN

We hope it’s not going to be a low-turnout election. There’s some important races on the ballot between mayor, city council, and statewide judicial races.

Similar counting schedule to the primary — i dont’ like the term “done counting.” but we’ll probably have enough ballots in right after the close of the polls or overnight. I’m expecting results to start appearing at 8pm as soon as polls close.

At what point in time will enough results be in to make calls? Depends on how close. But we’ll have the vast majority of ballots in by polls close.

Electronic pollbooks were used for the first time in may. “It went very well. I think we only had a few divisions in the enture city where they diddn’t really use them that much.”

Basically 99.9 percent of pollworkers made the transition easily.

We were able to run ballot security checks \[pollbook reconciliation much faster than with the paper pollbooks

I think a lot of coiunties are looking to make the transition, but the investment is a lot. This is one of those things where we’re trying — the changes that people want to see in elections, that evecrybody talks about, same day voter registration, early voting, that kind of stuff, those things are only possible if you have electronic pollbooks. Also makes the mail voting process more secure as well.

It makes the whole election much more secure and it future proofs your election.

Philly is leading in future proofing elections

Makes things much quicker.

Lots of other innovations that aren’t as public facing. We upgraded call center phones. Went from landlines to voice over internet phones. Upgraded call center in how we dispatch techs on election day. Made it more efficient.

The funding we got from the state was limited to certain stuff. A lot of this stuff comes from the mayor and city council making investments in the past year. Pollbooks, plus new staff positions. We expanded our IT unit. We used to rely on the city center IT. we competed for resources.

Now the big thing is just hiring people. We have the money for it, we just need to bring people in.

We’ve been preparing for 2024 since the day after the 2020 general election. We have never stopped planning. We don’t see any one election as a dry run, it’s its own second thing.

You’re always preparing.

The septa contract expires on the 31st. If anyone is concerned about a septa strike and getting to the polls: the deadline to apply for a mail ballot is the 31st. If you have any concerns, apply.

By the time you know whether there will be a strike or not, the deadline will have passed.

Don’t wait until there’s a strike to figure out how you’re going to vote.

The biggest issue is the multiple counties that have had ballot issues. “That&#39;ll be important for voters to pay attention, because that’s not something that happens too often.”

Somewhere in the ballpark of nine

Two were related to county commissioner races

Warren (had it listed as vote for not more than three… if they do that, it’s an overvote)

One other that was like this

Lancaster

Two had instructions that identified a white secrecy envelope instead of yellow

Wilkes barre — affected 1,500 voters, there was a data match issue and people didn’t get the right

They should “as far as i know, every county has done so. Nmy fear though is that once a voter has submitt4ed a ballot already, they may get another mailing and disregard it as junk mail.”

As a former election director, I think that the move to electronic pollbooks is a good thing. I wouldn’t be surprised if within five years every county is utilizing them.

It’s a win win. It’s a win on the front end for the pollworkerd and voters, it saves time in check in. it helps avoid mistakes… sometimes people just skip a page and don’t see a supplemental book

Also, counties are required to give every voter credit for whether they ovted. Right now, you have to scan barcodes into SURE. it’s a labor intensive process. But with electronic books you can upload data with the touch of a button.

I think it’s just a matter of making sure people know how they work.

When i wsa a director, i was worried about them shutting down or something.

No doubt, the cost is always going to be a factor for counties. I’m kind of blanking on act 88. I thought it could be used for equipment. Definitely a good use.

2020 was something that hopefully we’ll never have to go through again.

There was nobody that could have predicted the number of ballots that were going to come in. nobody was prepared…npobody could have planned for the pandemic and the number pf peop\[le who were goingt o be voting by mail.

Counties have adjusted to that, many of them, not all. They know the amount of space they need to conduct in person amd mail ballots. They’ve purchased openers and slicers and sorters. And that was huge, none of us had that in 2020. Everything was done by hand.

Counties have made the adjustment. They understand the time it takes now. But sauying that, i would still strongly advocate and the committee of seventy advocates for an early processing period.

There is a need for that to occur. We are going next eyart to have a significant number ofb mail ballots again. We will certainly be prepared, but pre-processing would

I always said that theidffernce between the muibnicipa and federal year is big. The prep for miniciap is harder.building ballots is hard because there are so many races. But the only advoantage to counties inthe miniauip year is that there’s lower voter engagement….so the counties, especially the small couties, had the bandwidth.

It’s exactly the opposite in a federal year.

Number of polls and workers, etc, stays the same. Prep doesn’t change. Amount of time we spend doesn’t change. There’s ust a fluctuation of workload.

I think counties have always taken a position that ou don’t want things changing as you get close to an election.

SCHMIDT

Automatic voter reg

- Last non fed election cycle, 2021, comparison.

- Since Sept 19, 11,303 new registrations. 7,323 new reg for 2021. This seems to be working.

Typically we see lower turnout for municipal elections. “I’d like to see us reverse that.”

October 31 mail ballot deadline

Counties have received 938,910 mail ballot applications.

Completed ballots must be returned by 8p. You can also vote by mail in person at your county election office up to election day.

Issues

- Some ballots too heavy, some had an inside envelope that was the wrong color/didn’t square with instructions.

- Schmidt: election admin with experience have been leaving, this increases likelihood for errors. These errors are not intentional or malicious.

- Ballot date issues?

- Voting by mail is not complicated just fyi.

- You need to have it in the envelope. You need to sign the affidavit. You need to date it. Re the date, “it’s pretty terrible that we can’t count those ballots” but is what it is.

- There’s still litigation on that, we’ll see how it shakes out on the federal level.

- There’s flexibility in the code for a reason. But we want to avoid material differences, like a type of ballot being counted in one county and not another. We give advice to try to lead to uniformity and do everything we can to promote that. It’s a balance.

- Last-minute guidance from DOS in 2020 was bad. It was frustrating for me as a commissioner. This year we put in place a deadline for issuing guidance, which is 45 days before the election. We did that the other day. There are things not under our control, like court decisions that come last-minute. But in those cases, we do try to act expeditiously to give election admin as much time as possible to adjust.

- “Withdrawing from ERIC would have a negative impact on election integrity in Pennsylvania.”
