  "body": "HARRISBURG — Lawmakers have finalized Pennsylvania’s new $47.6 billion budget — and no one is completely happy.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Josh Shapiro didn’t get recreational marijuana or a tax on skill games; legislative Democrats didn’t get a minimum wage increase; and legislative Republicans didn’t get tax cuts.\n\nStill, <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/07/pennsylvania-budget-public-schools-economic-development-scholarships-josh-shapiro-legislature/\">plenty made it into the final plan</a>. It increases K-12 education spending, <a href=\"https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/07/pennsylvania-legislature-budget-deal-education-spending-public-schools-josh-shapiro/\">sends $500 million to the state’s poorest schools</a>, funnels new dollars into economic development, and creates a new college scholarship program.\n\nFor more insight on the spending plan, Spotlight PA’s Capitol reporter Stephen Caruso is hosting a live panel.\n\nSpotlight PA held a free panel discussion on the major components of the budget, the politics that shaped the deal, and what was left on the cutting room floor.\n\n<strong>Our panelists were:</strong>\n\n- <strong>Stephen Caruso,</strong> Capitol reporter, Spotlight PA\n\n- <strong>Kristina Moon,</strong> senior attorney, Education Law Center\n\n- <strong>Mustafa Rashed,</strong> president &amp; CEO, Bellevue Strategies\n\n- <strong>Stan Saylor,</strong> former House GOP appropriations chair\n\n{{<vimeo id=\"990627534\" secret=\"89f8de8242\" >}}\n\n<strong>» Spotlight PA’s events operate on a “pay-what-you-can” honor system.</strong> If you value this public-service event, pay it forward and contribute any amount to Spotlight PA now so we can keep our programming free for everyone: <a href=\"http://spotlightpa.org/donate\">spotlightpa.org/donate</a>.\n",
